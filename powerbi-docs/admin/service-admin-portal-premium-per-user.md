# Manage Premium Per User

Go to the **Admin portal** access this feature. For information about how to get to and use the Admin portal, see [About the Admin portal](service-admin-portal.md).

Premium per user is a new way to license Premium features on a per user basis. After at least one user is assigned a Premium per user license, the associated features can be turned on in any workspace. Admins can manage the auto refresh and dataset workload settings that are shown to users and their default values. For example, access to the XMLA Endpoint can be turned off, set to read-only, or set to read-write.
