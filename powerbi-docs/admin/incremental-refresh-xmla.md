# Advanced incremental refresh with the XMLA endpoint

Datasets in a Premium capacity with the [XMLA endpoint](service-premium-connect-tools.md) enabled for **read-write** operations allow more advanced dataset refresh and partition management operations through tool, scripting, and API support. In addition, refresh operations through the XMLA endpoint are not limited to [48 refreshes per day](../connect-data/refresh-data.md#data-refresh), and the [scheduled refresh timeout](../connect-data/refresh-troubleshooting-refresh-scenarios.md#scheduled-refresh-timeout) is not imposed.

## Refresh management with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

SSMS can be used to view and manage partitions created by the application of incremental refresh policies. This allows, for example, to refresh a specific historical partition not in the incremental range to perform a back-dated update without having to refresh all historical data. SSMS can also be used to load historical data for very large datasets by incrementally adding/refreshing historical partitions in batches.

### Override incremental refresh behavior

With SSMS, you also have more control over how to invoke incremental refreshes by using [Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL)](/analysis-services/tmsl/tabular-model-scripting-language-tmsl-reference?view=power-bi-premium-current) and the [Tabular Object Model (TOM)](/analysis-services/tom/introduction-to-the-tabular-object-model-tom-in-analysis-services-amo?view=power-bi-premium-current). For example, in SSMS, in Object Explorer, right-click a table and then select the **Process Table** menu option, and then click the **Script** button to generate a TMSL refresh command.

These parameters can be used with the TMSL refresh command to override the default incremental refresh behavior:

- **applyRefreshPolicy** – If a table has an incremental refresh policy defined, applyRefreshPolicy will determine if the policy is applied or not. If the policy is not applied, a process full operation will leave partition definitions unchanged and all partitions in the table will be fully refreshed. Default value is true.

- **effectiveDate** – If an incremental refresh policy is being applied, it needs to know the current date to determine rolling window ranges for the historical range and the incremental range. The effectiveDate parameter allows you to override the current date. This is useful for testing, demos, and business scenarios where data is incrementally refreshed up to a date in the past or the future (for example, budgets in the future). The default value is the current date.

```json
{ 
  "refresh": {
    "type": "full",

    "applyRefreshPolicy": true,
    "effectiveDate": "12/31/2013",

    "objects": [
      {
        "database": "IR_AdventureWorks", 
        "table": "FactInternetSales" 
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To learn more about overriding default incremental refresh behavior with TMSL, see [Refresh command](/analysis-services/tmsl/refresh-command-tmsl?view=power-bi-premium-current).

## Custom queries for detect data changes

TMSL and/or TOM can be used to override the detected data changes behavior. Not only can this be used to avoid persisting the last-update column in the in-memory cache, it can enable scenarios where a configuration/instruction table is prepared by ETL processes for the purpose of flagging only the partitions that need to be refreshed. This can create a more efficient incremental refresh process where only the required periods are refreshed, no matter how long ago data updates took place.

The pollingExpression is intended to be a lightweight M expression or name of another M query. It must return a scalar value and will be executed for each partition. If the value returned is different to what it was the last time an incremental refresh occurred, the partition is flagged for full processing.

The following example covers all 120 months in the historical range for backdated changes. Specifying 120 months instead of 10 years means data compression may not be quite as efficient, but avoids having to refresh a whole historical year, which would be more expensive when a month would be sufficient for a backdated change.

```json
"refreshPolicy": {
    "policyType": "basic",
    "rollingWindowGranularity": "month",
    "rollingWindowPeriods": 120,
    "incrementalGranularity": "month",
    "incrementalPeriods": 120,
    "pollingExpression": "<M expression or name of custom polling query>",
    "sourceExpression": [
    "let ..."
    ]
}
```
