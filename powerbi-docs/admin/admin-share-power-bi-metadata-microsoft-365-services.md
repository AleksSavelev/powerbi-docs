# Share data with your Microsoft 365 services

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

This article is aimed at Power BI administrators and decision makers who need to know how and where Power BI metadata is being used.

Power BI metadata sharing with Microsoft 365 services is a feature that allows metadata from Power BI to be shared with Microsoft 365 services (typically via [Microsoft Graph](/graph/overview) and combined with data from across Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with millions of users. The feature is disabled by default.

When shared with Microsoft 365 services, Power BI content will be listed in the Most Recently Viewed list on the Office.com home page. The Power BI content affected includes reports, dashboards, apps, workbooks, paginated reports, and workspaces. The information required by the Most Recently Viewed functionality includes:

* The display name of the content
* When the content was last accessed
* The type of content that was accessed (report, dashboard etc.)

See [the complete list of Power BI metadata that is shared with Microsoft 365 services](#data-that-will-be-shared-with-microsoft-365).

## How to turn on sharing with Microsoft 365 services

To enable sharing Power BI metadata with Microsoft 365 services, a Power BI administrator must turn on the **[Share data with your Microsoft 365 services](./service-admin-portal-share-data-microsoft-365-services.md)** tenant setting. Before turning on the experience, the administrator should review the list of [data that will be shared with Microsoft 365](#data-that-will-be-shared-with-microsoft-365).

## Data residency

If Power BI and your Microsoft 365 services are in different geographic regions, information may flow outside the region it's stored in. By enabling this setting, the Power BI administrator explicitly opts in to this feature, and acknowledges enabling these cross-service capabilities may result in Power BI metadata flowing outside the geographic region it's stored in. For more information, see [Where data is located when Power BI data is shared with your Microsoft 365 services](./service-admin-m365-data-access-storage.md).
