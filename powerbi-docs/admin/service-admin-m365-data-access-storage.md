# Where data is located when Power BI data is shared with your Microsoft 365 services

The Power BI administrator can use the **Allow your Microsoft 365 services to process or store Power BI data which may be outside of your Power BI tenant's geographic area** switch to share Power BI content on the Office.com home page. Power BI and Microsoft 365 are distinct and separately operated Microsoft cloud services each deployed according to their own service specific data center alignment rules, even when purchased together. Accordingly, your Microsoft 365 Services and Power BI service may not be deployed in the same geographic region. When this Power BI tenant setting is enabled, Power BI data shared with Microsoft 365 may be processed or stored in the Microsoft 365 region even if it is a different region than where Power BI is deployed.
