# View usage metrics

Go to the **Admin portal** to access this feature. For information about how to get to and use the Admin portal, see [About the Admin portal](service-admin-portal.md).

**Usage metrics** let you monitor Power BI usage for your organization. It also shows which users and groups in your organization are the most active in Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> The first time you access the dashboard, or after you visit again after a long period of not viewing the dashboard, you'll likely see a loading screen while we load the dashboard.

After the dashboard loads, you see two sections of tiles. The first section includes usage data for individual users and the second section has similar information for groups.

Here's a breakdown of what you can see in each tile:

* Distinct count of all dashboards, reports, and datasets in the user workspace.

* Most consumed dashboard by number of users who can access it. For example: You have a dashboard that you shared with three users. You also added the dashboard to an app that two different users connected to. The dashboard's count would be 6 (1 + 3 + 2).

* The most popular content users connected to. The content would be anything the users could reach through the Get Data process, such as SaaS template apps, files, or databases.

* A view of your top users based on how many dashboards they have, both dashboards they created themselves and dashboards shared to them.

* A view of your top users based on how many reports they have.

The second section shows the same type of information, but based on groups. This section lets you see which groups in your organization are most active and what kind of content they're consuming.

With this information, you can get real insights into how people are using Power BI across your organization.
