# View refresh summary

The refresh summary admin settings page, lets you view your capacity's refresh history. You can also export the refresh history, and view additional details related to a specific refresh. The information in this page can help you investigate refresh errors, and establish a refresh schedule for the Power BI items that reside on your capacities.
