# Dataflow admin settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings.md).

## Create and use dataflows

Users in the organization can create and use dataflows. For an overview of dataflows, see [Self-service data prep in Power BI](../transform-model/dataflows/dataflows-introduction-self-service.md). To enable dataflows in a Premium capacity, see [Configure workloads](../enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This setting applies to the entire organization and cannot be limited to specific groups.
