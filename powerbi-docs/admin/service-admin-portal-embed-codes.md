# Manage embed codes

As an administrator, you can view the embed codes that are generated for sharing reports publicly using the [Publish to web from Power BI](../collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web.md) feature. You can also disable or delete embed codes.

## Disable embed codes

You can disable the *Publish to web* feature, or allow embed codes to only work in your organization. If you disable *Publish to web*, the existing embed codes are not deleted. When you reenable *Publish to web*, the existing embed codes will become active again.

Disabling the embed codes is described in [Publish to web](service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#publish-to-web).

## Delete embed codes

To delete embed codes, select the codes you want to delete and then select **Delete**.
