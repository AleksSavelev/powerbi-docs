# Manage embed codes

Go to the **Admin portal** to access this feature. For information about how to get to and use the Admin portal, see [About the Admin portal](service-admin-portal.md).

As an administrator, you can view the embed codes that are generated for your tenant to share reports publicly. You can also revoke or delete codes. [Learn more](../collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web.md)
