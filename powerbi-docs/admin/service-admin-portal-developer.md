# Developer admin settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings.md).

## Embed content in apps

Users in the organization can embed Power BI dashboards and reports in Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. Disabling this setting prevents users from being able to use the REST APIs to embed Power BI content within their application. [Learn more](../developer/embedded/embedded-analytics-power-bi.md)

## Allow service principals to use Power BI APIs

Web apps registered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) will use an assigned service principal to access Power BI APIs without a signed in user. To allow an app to use service principal authentication, its service principal must be included in an allowed security group. [Learn more](../developer/embedded/embed-service-principal.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Service principals inherit the permissions for all Power BI tenant settings from their security group. To restrict permissions, create a dedicated security group for service principals and add it to the 'Except specific security groups' list for the relevant, enabled Power BI settings.
