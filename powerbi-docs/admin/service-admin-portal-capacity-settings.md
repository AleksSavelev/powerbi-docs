# Manage Capacity settings

Go to the **Admin portal** to access this feature. For information about how to get to and use the Admin portal, see [About the Admin portal](service-admin-portal.md).

## Power BI Premium

The **Power BI Premium** tab enables you to manage any Power BI Premium capacities (EM or P SKU) that have been purchased for your organization. All users within your organization can see the **Power BI Premium** tab, but they only see contents within it if they are assigned as either a *Capacity admin* or a user that has assignment permissions. If a user does not have any permissions, the following message appears.

## Power BI Embedded

The **Power BI Embedded** tab enables you to view your Power BI Embedded (A SKU) capacities that you've purchased for your customer. Since you can only purchase A SKUs from Azure, you [manage embedded capacities in Azure](../developer/embedded/azure-pbie-create-capacity.md) from **the Azure portal**.

For more information about Power BI Embedded SKUs, see [Capacity and SKUs in Power BI embedded analytics](../developer/embedded/embedded-capacity.md).
