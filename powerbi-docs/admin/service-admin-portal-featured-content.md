# Manage featured content

Go to the **Admin portal** to access this feature. For information about how to get to and use the Admin portal, see [About the Admin portal](service-admin-portal.md).

As a Power BI admin, you can manage all the reports, dashboards, and apps that have been promoted to the Featured section on Power BI Home across your organization.

- In the Admin portal, select **Featured content**.

Here you see an overview of who featured the content, when it was featured, and all its relevant metadata. If something looks suspicious, or you want to clean up the Featured section, you can delete promoted content as needed.

See [Featured content](service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#featured-content) in this article for information about enabling featured content.
