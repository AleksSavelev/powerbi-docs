# Manage featured content

If the *featured content* feature is enabled in your organization, users can feature content in the **Featured** section of the Power BI Home page. See [Feature content on colleagues' Power BI Home page](../collaborate-share/service-featured-content.md) for details.

As a Power BI admin, you can monitor this featured content and remove it from the **Featured** section if necessary.

In the [Admin portal](service-admin-portal.md), select **Featured content**.

Here you see a list of all featured items along with their relevant metadata. If something looks suspicious, or you want to clean up the **Featured** section, you can delete featured items as needed.

To delete an item, mouseover and select the item, and then click the trash can that appears in the top ribbon, or choose **More options (...) > Delete**. It is possible to select multiple items and then delete.

See [Featured content](service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#featured-content) for information about enabling/disabling featured content.
