# Data protection in Power BI

## Overview

Power BI plays a key role in bringing data insights to everyone in an organization. However, as data becomes more accessible to inform decisions, risk of accidental oversharing or misuse of business-critical information increases.

Microsoft has world-class security capabilities to help protect customers from threats. Over 3,500 security researchers along with sophisticated AI models reason every day over 6.5+ trillion signals globally to help protect customers against threats at Microsoft.

Data protection capabilities in Power BI build on Microsoftâ€™s strengths in security and enable customers to empower every user with Power BI and better protect their data no matter how or where it is accessed.

With Power BI's data protection capabilities you can:

* **Classify and label sensitive Power BI data** using Microsoft Information Protection sensitivity labels used in Office and other Microsoft products.  
* **Enforce governance policies even when Power BI content is exported** to Excel, PowerPoint, PDF, and other supported export formats to help ensure data is protected even when it leaves Power BI.
* **Monitor and protect user activity on sensitive data in real time** with alerts, session monitoring, and risk remediation using Defender for Cloud Apps.
* **Empower security administrators** who use data protection reports and security investigation capabilities with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to enhance organizational oversight.
