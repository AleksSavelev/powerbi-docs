# User experience experiments admin settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings.md).

## Help Power BI optimize your experience

When this feature is enabled, individual users within the same organization might get minor user experience variations, including content, layout, and design, that the Power BI team is experimenting with before they go live for all users. This means different users in the same tenant might get a slightly different experience during the experiment. Enabling this feature allows Power BI team to make data-driven decision in which in-product experience is received more positively by users.
