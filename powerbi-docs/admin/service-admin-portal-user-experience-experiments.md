# User experience experiments admin settings

These settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings.md).

## Help Power BI optimize your experience

When this feature is enabled, users in the organization will get minor user experience variations, including content, layout, and design, that the Power BI team is experimenting with before they go live for all users.
