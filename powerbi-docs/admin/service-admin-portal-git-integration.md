# Git integration tenant settings

Git integration tenant settings are configured in the tenant settings section of the Admin portal. For information about how to get to and use tenant settings, see [About tenant settings](service-admin-portal-about-tenant-settings.md).

## Users can synchronize workspace items with their Git repositories (Preview)

When this setting is on, users can import and export workspace items to Git repositories for collaboration and version control. Turn off this setting to prevent users from syncing workspace items with their Git repositories. For more information, see [Tenant admin settings for git integration](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings).

## Users can export items to Git repositories in other geographical locations (Preview)

The workspace and the Git repository may reside in different geographies. Turn on this setting to allow users to export items to Git repositories in other geographies. For more information, see [Enable git actions on workspaces residing in other geographical locations](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings#enable-git-actions-on-workspaces-residing-in-other-geographical-locations).

## Users can export workspace items with applied sensitivity labels to Git repositories (Preview)

Turn on this setting to allow users to export items that have sensitivity labels to their Git repositories. For more information, see [Enable export of items that have sensitivity labels](/fabric/admin/git-integration-admin-settings#enable-export-of-items-that-have-sensitivity-labels).
