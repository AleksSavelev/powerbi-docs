# Dataflows best practices

Power BI **dataflows** are an enterprise-focused data prep solution, enabling an ecosystem of data that's ready for consumption, reuse, and integration. This article provides a list of best practices, with links to articles and other information that will help you understand and use dataflows to their full potential.

## Dataflows across the Power Platform

Dataflows can be used across various Power Platform technologies, such as Power Query, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and other Microsoft offerings. For more information about how dataflows can work across the Power Platform, see [using dataflows across Microsoft products](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-query/dataflows/overview-dataflows-across-power-platform-dynamics-365).


## Dataflows best practices table and links

The following table provides a collection of links to articles that describe best practices when creating or working with dataflows. The links include information about developing business logic, developing complex dataflows, re-use of dataflows, and how to achieve enterprise-scale with your dataflows.
