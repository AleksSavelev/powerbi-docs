# Updates to the experience in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

This article spells out the changes that are coming to the Power BI service, and maps the old experience to the new experience.

> [!NOTE]
> These features are currently under experimentation. Some customers may not see them yet. We'd love to hear your feedback at [Power BI Ideas](https://ideas.powerbi.com/ideas/).

Here’s an overview of the changes:

**Browse changes** The left navigation links for **Recent**, **Favorites**, and **Shared with me** full page lists are being combined in a new **Browse** tab. You can still search and filter these lists, and now you can even filter by keyword.

**Left navigation changes** A major change coming to the left navigation pane is tooltips. Before, to see what an icon represented in the left navigation pane, you had to expand the entire menu.

**Workspace flyout menu changes** The **My Workspace** link moves below the **Search** box in the workspace flyout menu.

**Get Data changes** The Get Data experience moves from the bottom of the left navigation pane to the **Create** tab.

## Browse changes

Introducing the **Browse** page:

**Browse** simplifies the left navigation. It includes as a sub-navigation all the lists that were previously available individually: **Recent**, **Favorites**, and **Shared with me**. 

### Improved filtering

It’s easier to find content in these lists with a new experience for filtering by keyword and improved filtering by content type, time, and endorsement.

:::image type="content" source="../create-reports/media/service-experience-changes/experience-new-filter.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the expanded filtering experience.":::

Any browser bookmarks you made for the **Recent**, **Favorites**, and **Shared with me** pages will now take you to the new **Browse** view for each.

The Browse page will also be available in the Power BI personal app for Microsoft Teams.

## Navigation pane changes

The left navigation pane will feature tooltips to explain what the icons represent. You see the tooltips by hovering over the icon in the nav pane.  With the new update, the left nav no longer expands. Instead, you hover over any icon and a tooltip appears.

:::image type="content" source="../create-reports/media/service-experience-changes/experience-new-tooltips.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the navigation pane with tooltips.":::

We're also updating the way item navigation occurs. Previously, you could navigate between items through the expanded left nav pane workspace dropdown. Because the updated left nav pane is permanently collapsed, this flow goes away. You can still navigate between items by selecting the workspace icon, then selecting the relevant item from your workspace page.

## Workspace menu flyout changes

In the previous workspace flyout, **My Workspace** was above the **Search** box.
 
:::image type="content" source="../create-reports/media/service-experience-changes/experience-old-my-workspace.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the old placement of My Workspace."::: 

It's shifting to below the **Search** box in the workspace flyout.

## Get Data changes

**Get data** is moving from the left navigation pane to the **Create** tab. Previously, to access **Get data**, you selected the icon at the bottom of the nav pane.

:::image type="content" source="../create-reports/media/service-experience-changes/experience-old-get-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the old location of Get Data.":::

Now the Get data experience is moving to the **Create** experience. You access it by selecting **Create** > **Report** > **these options**, and then you're on the **Get Data** page.
