# Supported browsers for Power BI

Power BI is designed to work with any of the supported browsers mentioned below. However, performance differs depending on your choice of a browser. If you're using Internet Explorer in particular, you may encounter worse performance. We strongly recommend switching from Internet Explorer to a modern browser, including Microsoft Edge. If you still encounter unacceptable performance, test other supported modern browsers to see if they provide better results for your Power BI solution.

Power BI supports these browsers on all platforms where they're available:

- Microsoft Edge Chromium
- Internet Explorer 11. Some advanced features, such as lineage view, aren't supported in Internet Explorer. See [Data lineage (preview)](../collaborate-share/service-data-lineage.md) for details.
- - Beginning **August 17, 2021** Microsoft 365 apps and services, including Power BI, will no longer support Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11). Please refer to [this Microsoft 365 blog post](https://aka.ms/AA97tsw) for more information.
- Chrome desktop latest version
- Safari Mac latest version
- Firefox desktop latest version. Firefox may change the fonts used in Power BI 

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI doesn't run in any browsers in iOS10 or previous versions.
