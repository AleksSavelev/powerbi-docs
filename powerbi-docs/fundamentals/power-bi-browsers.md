# Supported browsers for Power BI

Power BI is designed to work with any of the supported browsers mentioned below. However, performance differs depending on your choice of a browser. If you're using Internet Explorer in particular, you may encounter worse performance. We strongly recommend switching from Internet Explorer to a modern browser, including Microsoft Edge. If you still encounter unacceptable performance, test other supported modern browsers to see if they provide better results for your Power BI solution.

Power BI supports these browsers on all platforms where they're available:

- Microsoft Edge Chromium.
- Internet Explorer 11. However, some advanced features, such as lineage view, aren't supported in Internet Explorer. 
- Microsoft 365 apps and services, including Power BI, will no longer support Internet Explorer 11 (IE 11) starting in August 2021. The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be retired on June 15, 2022. Refer to [this Microsoft 365 blog post](https://aka.ms/AA97tsw) for more information. 
- Chrome desktop latest version.
- Safari Mac latest version.
- Firefox desktop latest version. Firefox may change the fonts used in Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> Power BI doesn't run in any browsers in iOS10 or previous versions.

## Fonts

Power BI uses the **Segoe UI** font for text as its default, and the **Din** font for numbers, and other fonts when creating reports, dashboards, and other artifacts, which may not be available on non-Windows computers such as Macs. As a result the font, alignment of artifacts, and visuals for the same report will look different when viewed on a Windows computer versus a Mac.

The **Calibri** and **Cambria** fonts are only installed on Macs that have Microsoft Office installed, but aren't included in the default set of fonts on Macs.

If you're creating reports viewed on Mac computers, select fonts that will display properly on Macs. 

The following links provide information about which fonts are available on Macs. The links are not maintained by Microsoft, and are provided only for reference and further reading.
