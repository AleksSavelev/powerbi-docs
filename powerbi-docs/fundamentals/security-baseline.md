# Azure security baseline for Power BI

This security baseline applies guidance from the [Azure Security Benchmark version 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/benchmarks/overview) to Power BI. The Azure Security Benchmark provides recommendations on how you can secure your cloud solutions on Azure. The content is grouped by the **security controls** defined by the Azure Security Benchmark and the related guidance applicable to Power BI. **Controls** not applicable to Power BI have been excluded.

To see how Power BI completely maps to the Azure Security Benchmark, see the [full Power BI security baseline mapping file](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/SecurityBenchmarks/tree/master/Azure%20Offer%20Security%20Baselines).

## Network Security

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Network Security](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-network-security).*

### NS-3: Establish private network access to Azure services

**Guidance**: Power
BI supports connecting your Power BI
tenant to a Private link endpoint and disabling public internet access.

## Identity Management

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Identity Management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-identity-management).*

### IM-1: Standardize Azure Active Directory as the central identity and authentication system

**Guidance**: Power BI is integrated with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) which is Azure's default identity and access management service. You should standardize on Azure AD to govern your organization’s identity and access management.

Securing Azure AD should be a high priority in your organization’s cloud security practice. Azure AD provides an identity secure score to help you assess identity security posture relative to Microsoft’s best practice recommendations. Use the score to gauge how closely your configuration matches best practice recommendations, and to make improvements in your security posture.

Note: Azure AD supports external identities that allow users without a Microsoft account to sign in to their applications and resources with their external identity.

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-2: Manage application identities securely and automatically

**Guidance**: Power BI and Power BI Embedded support the use of Service Principals. Store any Service Principal credentials used for encrypting or accessing Power BI in a Key Vault, assign proper access policies to the vault and regularly review access permissions.

Automate Premium workspace and dataset tasks with service principals https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/admin/service-premium-service-principal

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-3: Use Azure AD single sign-on (SSO) for application access

**Guidance**: Power BI uses Azure Active Directory to provide identity and access management to Azure resources, cloud applications, and on-premises applications. This includes enterprise identities such as employees, as well as external identities such as partners, vendors, and suppliers. This enables single sign-on (SSO) to manage and secure access to your organization’s data and resources on-premises and in the cloud. Connect all your users, applications, and devices to the Azure AD for seamless, secure access and greater visibility and control.

- [Understand Application SSO with Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on)

**Azure Security Center monitoring**: Not applicable

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-4: Use strong authentication controls for all Azure Active Directory based access

**Guidance**: Power BI is integrated with Azure AD that supports strong authentication controls through multi-factor authentication (MFA), and strong passwordless methods.
- Multi-factor authentication - Enable Azure AD MFA and follow Azure Security Center Identity and Access Management recommendations for some best practices in your MFA setup. MFA can be enforced on all, select users or at the per-user level based on sign-in conditions and risk factors.
- Passwordless authentication – Three passwordless authentication options are available: Windows Hello for Business, Microsoft Authenticator app, and on-premises authentication methods such as smart cards.

For administrator and privileged users, ensure the highest level of strong authentication is used, followed by rolling out the appropriate strong authentication policy to other users.

Note: MFA can only be enforced for user accounts enabled in Azure AD. Power BI Service Principals do not support the use of MFA.

**Responsibility**: Customer

### IM-5: Monitor and alert on account anomalies

**Guidance**: Define anomaly detection policies in Microsoft Cloud App Security which can be independently scoped, so that they apply to only the users and groups that you want to include. These anomaly detection policies can help detect and monitor behavior anomalies related to users accessing and using Power BI.

### IM-7: Eliminate unintended credential exposure

**Guidance**: For Power BI embedded applications
it is recommended to implement Credential Scanner to identify credentials within your
code. Credential Scanner will also encourage moving discovered credentials to
more secure locations such as Azure Key Vault.

Store any encryption keys or Service Principal credentials used for encrypting or accessing Power BI in a Key Vault, assign proper access policies to the vault and regularly review access permissions.
 
For GitHub, you can use
native secret scanning feature to identify credentials or other form of secrets
within the code.

## Privileged Access

*For more information, see the [Azure Security Benchmark: Privileged Access](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-privileged-access).*

### PA-1: Protect and limit highly privileged users

**Guidance**: To reduce risk and follow the principle of least privilege, it is recommended to keep membership of the Power BI administrators to a small number of people. Users with these privileged permissions could potentially access and modify all any management feature for the organization. Global administrators, via Microsoft 365 or Azure Active Directory, implicitly possess administrator rights in the Power BI service as well.

Power BI has below highly privileged accounts:
- Global admin
- Billing admin
- License admin
- User admin
- Power BI admin
- Power BI Premium Capacity admin
- Power BI Embedded Capacity admin

Power BI supports session policies in Azure AD to enable conditional access policies and route sessions used in Power BI through the Cloud App Security service.

Enable just-in-time (JIT) privileged access for the Power BI admin accounts using M365 Privileged access management.

### PA-3: Review and reconcile user access regularly

**Guidance**: As a Power BI service admin, you can analyze usage for all Power BI resources at the tenant level by using custom reports based on the Power BI activity log. You can download the activities by using a REST API or PowerShell cmdlet. You can also filter the activity data by date range, user, and activity type.

You must meet these requirements to access the Power BI activity log:
- You must either be a global admin or a Power BI service admin.
- You have installed the [Power BI Management cmdlets](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt) locally or use the Power BI Management cmdlets in Azure Cloud Shell.

Once these requirements are met you can follow the guidance below to track user activity within Power BI:

### PA-4: Set up emergency access in Azure AD

**Guidance**: Power BI is integrated with Azure Active Directory and M365 to manage its resources. To prevent being accidentally locked out of your M365 tenant, or Azure AD organization, set up an emergency access account for access when normal administrative accounts cannot be used. Emergency access accounts are usually highly privileged, and they should not be assigned to specific individuals. Emergency access accounts are limited to emergency or "break glass"' scenarios where normal administrative accounts can't be used.

You should ensure that the credentials (such as password, certificate, or smart card) for emergency access accounts are kept secure and known only to individuals who are authorized to use them only in an emergency.

### PA-6: Use privileged access workstations

**Guidance**: Secured, isolated workstations are critically
important for the security of sensitive roles like administrators, developers,
and critical service operators. Use highly secured user workstations and/or
Azure Bastion for administrative tasks related to managing Power BI. Use Azure Active Directory, Microsoft
Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), and/or Microsoft Intune to deploy a
secure and managed user workstation for administrative tasks. The secured
workstations can be centrally managed to enforce secured configuration including
strong authentication, software and hardware baselines, restricted logical and
network access.

### DP-3: Monitor for unauthorized transfer of sensitive data

**Guidance**: This control can be partially achieved by using Microsoft
Cloud App Security support for Power BI.

Using Cloud App
Security with Power BI, you can help protect your Power BI reports, data, and
services from unintended leaks or breaches. With Cloud App Security, you create
conditional access policies for your organization’s data, using real-time
session controls in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), that help to ensure your
Power BI analytics are secure. Once these policies have been set, administrators
can monitor user access and activity, perform real-time risk analysis, and set
label-specific controls.

### GS-2: Define enterprise segmentation strategy 

**Guidance**: Establish an enterprise-wide strategy to segmenting access to assets using a combination of identity, network, application, subscription, management group, and other controls.

Carefully balance the need for security separation with the need to enable daily operation of the systems that need to communicate with each other and access data.

Ensure that the segmentation strategy is implemented consistently across control types including network security, identity and access models, and application permission/access models, and human process controls.
