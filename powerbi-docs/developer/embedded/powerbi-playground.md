# What is the Power BI embedded analytics playground?

The Power BI embedded analytics playground is makes it easier for you to learn, explore and try out Power BI embedded analytics.

You can get hands-on coding experience, embed your own reports, and interact with Power BI client APIs to see instant results.
There are also interactive showcases that show you how to apply these features in your applications, and a learning center to help you find all the relevant samples, tutorials, and documentation youâ€™ll need for successful integration.
The playground has the following main experiences:

* [Developer sandbox](#developer-sandbox)
* [Explore our APIs](#explore-our-apis)
* [Showcases](#showcases)
* [Learning center](#learning-center)

## Developer sandbox

Go to the developer sandbox for hands-on experience using our client APIs. You can use the APIs with our sample report or with your own report.

Drag and drop code snippets into the report, or type them directly into the code editor area to see how they work.

## Showcases

Our showcases give you an opportunity to experience our client APIs in action. Each showcase presents an application that demonstrates what you can achieve with one or more of the client APIs.

The showcases code is open-sourced, and you can find the code behind all of them in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Embedded-Showcases/).

## Learning center

The Learning center is a collection of Power BI embedded analytics resources. Here you can dive into our documentation, learn about our APIs, find our developer samples and videos, and learn where to get help.
