# Object level security

Object-level security (OLS) enables model authors to secure specific tables or columns from report viewers. For example, a column that includes personal data can be restricted so that only certain viewers can see and interact with it. In addition, you can also restrict object names and metadata. This added layer of security prevents users without the appropriate access levels from discovering business critical or sensitive personal information like employee or financial records. For viewers that donâ€™t have the requisite permission, it's as if the secured tables or columns don't exist.  

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you have a report that uses OLS that you want to embed into an app. To create a report that uses OLS, see [Object level security (OLS)](../../enterprise/service-admin-ols.md).

## Embed a report that use object level security

The process of [generating embed tokens](generate-embed-token.md#row-level-security) for items that use OLS is the same as for RLS.

If the report you want to embed is using one of the following scenarios, you might need to take some extra steps:

* [Paginated reports](embed-paginated-reports.md)
* [SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)](sql-server-analysis-services-embed.md)
* Azure AD
* Single sign-on

## Considerations and limitations

* Datasets with OLS configured for one or more table or column objects aren't supported with these Power BI features:

  * Q&A visualizations
  * Quick insights visualizations
  * Smart narrative visualizations
  * Excel Data Types gallery

* Row-level security and object-level security can't be combined from different roles. An error is generated at query time for users who are members of such a combination of roles.

* Dynamic calculations (measures, KPIs, DetailRows) are automatically restricted if they reference a secured table or column. While you can't explicitly secure a measure, you can implicitly secure a measure by updating the expression to refer to a secured table or column.

* Relationships that reference a secured column work, as long as the table the column is in isn't secured.
