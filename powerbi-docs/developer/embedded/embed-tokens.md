# Embedded analytics application tokens

To consume Power BI content you need an access token. Depending on your solution, this token can be either an [Azure AD token](#azure-ad-token) or an [embed token](#embed-token).

If you're using the *embed for your customers* solution, your web app users will be granted access to Power BI content (such as reports, dashboards and tiles), according to the *embed token* that was generated by your application.

>[!NOTE]
>When using the *embed for your customers* solution, you can use any authentication method you want to allow access to your web app.

If you're using the *embed for your organization* solution, your web app users will be authenticating against Azure AD using their own credentials. Your app users ***credentials*** will determine which Power BI content they can access.

## Azure AD token

In both *embed for your customers* and *embed for your organization* solutions, ***before your web app can access Power BI service, it must authenticate against Azure AD.*** After successfully authenticating against Azure AD, your web app receives an [Azure AD token](#azure-ad-token) allowing it to access Power BI. This token is required for all [REST API](/rest/api/power-bi/) operations, and it expires after an hour.

When using the *embed for your customers* solution, the *Azure AD token* is used to generate *embed tokens*.

## Embed token

When you're using the *embed for your customers* solution, your web app needs to know which Power BI content its user can access. Use the [embed token](/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken) REST API, to generate an *embed token*, which specifies the following:

* Which content your web app can access

* Your web app's access level (view, create, or edit)

For more information, see [Considerations when generating an embed token](generate-embed-token.md).

## Authentication flows

This section describes the authentication flows for the *embed for your customers* and *embed for your organization* embedding solutions.

### Embed for your customers

The *Embed for your customers* solution uses a non-authentication flow. Users do not need to sign in to Azure AD, to access Power BI. Instead, your web app uses a dedicated Azure AD identity to authenticate and generate the *embed token*. The dedicated identity can be one of the following:

* **[Service principal](embed-service-principal.md)**

    Your web app uses the Azure AD [service principal object](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals#service-principal-object) to authenticate against Azure AD and get an *Azure AD token*. Using a service principal doesn't require user authorization, it only requires your web  app to authorize against Azure AD, and is  the Azure AD recommended authentication method.

* **Master user**

    Your web app uses a [Power BI Pro](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-purchasing-power-bi-pro) or a [Premium Per User (PPU)](/power-bi/admin/service-premium-per-user-faq) account to authenticate against Azure AD and get the *Azure AD token*. When using a *master user* you'll need to define your app [permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent) (also known as scopes). The *master user* or *tenant admin* is required to grant consent for using these permissions.

After successful authentication against Azure AD, your web app will generate an [embed token](/rest/api/power-bi/embedtoken) to allow its users to access specific Power BI content.

>[!NOTE]
>* To embed using the *embed for your customers* solution, you'll need an A, EM, or P SKU.
>* To [move to production](move-to-production.md) you'll need a capacity.

The following diagram show the authentication flow for the *embed for your customers* solution.

1. Web app user authenticates against your web app (with your authentication method).

2. Your web app uses a *service principal* or a *master user* to authenticate against Azure AD.

3. Your web app gets an *Azure AD token* token from Azure AD, and uses it to access Power BI REST APIs. Access to the Power BI REST APIs is given according to your authentication method:
    * If you're using a *service principal*, ***you donâ€™t need to set any additional permissions*** to access all the Power BI REST APIs.
    * If you're using a *master user*, the *master user* (or a tenant administrator) should consent to using the Power BI REST APIs that your web app is requesting permission for.

4. Your web app calls the generate token REST API requesting the *embed token*, which specifies which Power BI content can be embedded.

5. The REST API returns the *embed token* to your web app.

6. The web app passes the embed token to the user's web browser.

7. The web app user uses the embed token to access Power BI.

### Embed for your organization

The *Embed for your organization* solution uses an interactive flow. Your user's authenticate against Azure AD using their Power BI credentials. Users need to grant consent to your web app requested permissions. Consent is granted in the Microsoft *Permissions requested* dialog pop-up window. Any Power BI content the web app user has access to, can be embedded.

1. Web app user accesses the web app.

2. The web app redirects the web app user to Azure AD.

3. The web app user authenticates against Azure AD using his Power BI credentials.

4. Azure AD redirects the web app user back to the web app with the Azure AD token.

5. The web app passes the Azure AD token to the user's web browser.

6. Your Power BI web app uses the Azure AD token to embed any Power BI content the web app user has rights to view.
