### Power BI Embedded

| Table |  Description |
|:---------|:-------------|------------------|
| [AzureActivity](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azureactivity) | Entries from the Azure Activity log that provides insight into any subscription-level or management group level events that have occurred in Azure.    |                             |                                                   | 
| [AzureDiagnostics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azurediagnostics)   | Stores resource logs for Azure services that use Azure Diagnostics mode. Resource logs describe the internal operation of Azure resources. |
| [AzureMetrics](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/azuremetrics)   | Metric data emitted by Azure services that measure their health and performance. |

For a reference of all Azure Monitor Logs / Log Analytics tables, see the [Azure Monitor Log Table Reference](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/tables-resourcetype).

## Activity log

You can select **Engine** and/or the **AllMetrics** categories.

### Engine

The engine category instructs the resource to log the events listed below. For each event, there are properties.

|     Event Name     |     Event Description     |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    Audit Login    |    Records all new connection to   the engine events since the trace started.    |
|    Session Initialize    |    Records all session   initialization events since the trace started.    |
|    Vertipaq Query Begin    |    Records all VertiPaq SE query   begin events since the trace started.    |
|    Query Begin    |    Records all query begin events   since the trace started.    |
|    Query End    |    Records all query end events   since the trace started.    |
|    Vertipaq Query End    |    Records all VertiPaq SE query   end events since the trace started.    |
|    Audit Logout    |    Records all disconnect from   engine events since the trace started.    |
|    Error    |    Records all engine error   events since the trace started.    |
