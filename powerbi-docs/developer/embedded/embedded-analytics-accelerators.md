# Embedded analytics accelerator solutions from Microsoft partner

Microsoft partners offer accelerators to facilitate embedded analytics for ISVs. These accelerators are designed to help you quickly embed Power BI analytics into your application. The following table lists the different accelerators from our partners:

Embedded analytics accelerators are a cost-effective way to speed up time-to-market or expedite a PoC/pilot for your multi-tenant, customer facing Power BI embedded analytics solution​.

* Accelerators provide enhanced personalized user experience and added functionality for embedding Power BI for customers (aka AppOwnsData embedding scenario) with flexible end user authentication and authorization options​.

* They require no coding or minimal code development only for the client front-end, while hiding the implementation details of a sophisticated Power BI embedded solution that supports multi-tenancy and end user permissions management.​

* Once installed you can white-label the solution, configure its capabilities and customize the user experience.​

* Accelerators are developed and owned by our partners and are available for self-deployment from Azure marketplace into your Azure environment using your Power BI/Fabric tenant. ​

* An accelerator can co-exist or be fully integrated with your original application​.

* Each accelerator is based on proven code from the partner that already implements the product team’s best practices.​

Choose from several partner accelerators that vary in their deployment, acquisition/billing options and their capabilities. ​
