# Plan your transition to Power BI Embedded Gen2

This article provides information about key dates for migrating Power BI Embedded capacity to the latest platform.

Over the last several months, we've been working to make many improvements to Power BI Embedded. Changes include updates to performance, scaling, management overhead, and improved insight to utilization metrics. This next generation of Power BI Embedded, referred to as Power BI Embedded Gen2, has officially moved from preview to general availability as of October 4, 2021.

If your organization is using the previous version of Power BI Embedded, you're required to migrate capacities to the modern Gen2 platform. The key dates for you to be aware of are listed below:

* **October 4, 2021** - Power BI Embedded Gen2 is generally available.
* **November 15, 2021** - We start sending notifications reminding customers to migrate.
* **January 15, 2022** - Microsoft begins migration of Embedded capacities to the modern Gen2 platform for all organizations.

## Self-migration to Embedded Generation 2

If you want to perform your own migration to the latest platform before January 15, 2022, it's easy to transition. You can upgrade through either the Azure portal or the API. Migrating doesn't interrupt your Power BI service. The change typically completes within a minute and won't take more than 10 minutes.

## Transition from preview to Embedded Gen 2 general availability

Customers using Power BI Embedded Gen2 in preview don't need to take any action to transition to the general availability release.
