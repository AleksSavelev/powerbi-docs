# Create a report quickly in Jupyter notebook

If you're using Jupyter notebook, you can create a Power BI report with just a few steps without having to leave the notebook. This lets you easily tell the story of your data using Power BI's visualization capabilities as part of your notebook experience.  
These are temporary reports that aren't saved automatically. Every time you run the code a new report will be created and the old one will be removed. You can manually save the report for later use in your notebook or in Power BI.

## Import modules

First, import the necessary methods and classes from `powerbiclient` + import `pandas` to create a DataFrame.

```python
from powerbiclient import QuickVisualize, get_dataset_config
import pandas as pd
```

## Create a pandas DataFrame

Create a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) from a sample CSV file and update it. The following example shows just one example of creating a DataFrame.  (users can create df in any way they want, this is just an example)

```python
# Import your own CSV as a pandas data frame
df = pd.read_csv('Financial Sample.csv')

# Perform preprocessing
df = df.drop(['Month Number', ' Month Name ', 'Year'], axis=1)
df = df.loc[df['Units Sold'] > 1000]
df['Discounted'] = df[' Discount Band '] != ' None '
```

## Authenticate to Power BI

You need to authenticate when quick creating quick visualization features just like you do when embedding a report and . There are three authentication options:

* Pass an access token (string)

* Create an instance of AuthenticationResult. This be an interactive login or a device code login.

* Donâ€™t pass anything. If you don't pass anything, the default is a device code login.

```python
# Authenticate to Power BI using the device code authentication method

from powerbiclient.authentication import DeviceCodeLoginAuthentication

auth = DeviceCodeLoginAuthentication()
```

For more information about authentication, check out the [github wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-jupyter/wiki#authenticate-to-power-bi-and-acquire-an-access-token).

## Create and render a quick visualize instance

Create a `QuickVisualize` instance from the [DataFrame you created](#create-a-pandas-dataframe). Use the `get_dataset_config` utility method to help create a [`dataset_create_config`](/javascript/api/powerbi/powerbi-models/idatasetcreateconfiguration) object from the pandas DataFrame. If you're using a DataFrame other than pandas, parse the data yourself.

```python
# Create a Power BI report from your data
qv_report = QuickVisualize(get_dataset_config(df), auth=auth)

# Render report
qv_report
```

## Customize the report (optional)

Once you created the report, you can customize it based on the data.
You can define the size of he container.

```python
# Set new width and height for the container
qv_report.set_size(350, 600)
```

The user can edit the visuals and save them. For more information, see [Interact with autogenerated "quick" reports in the Power BI service](../../create-reports/service-interact-quick-report.md).
