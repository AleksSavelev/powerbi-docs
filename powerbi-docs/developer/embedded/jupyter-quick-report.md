# Create a report quickly in Jupyter notebook

If you're using Jupyter notebook, you can create a Power BI report with just a few steps. These are temporary report that aren't saved automatically. Every time you run the code a new report will be created and the old one will be removed. You can save the report manually, if you want.

## Import modules

First, import the necessary methods and classes from `powerbiclient` + import `pandas` to create a data frame.

```python
from powerbiclient import QuickVisualize, get_dataset_config
import pandas as pd
```

## Create a pandas data frame

Create a [pandas data frame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) from a sample CSV file and update it. The following example shows just one example of creating a data frame.  (users can create df in any way they want, this is just an example)

## Authenticate to Power BI

You need to authenticate when quick creating quick visualization features just like you do when embedding a report and . There are three authentication options:

* Pass an access token (string)

* Create an instance of AuthenticationResult. This be an interactive login or a device code login.

* Don’t pass anything. If you don't pass anything, the default is a device code login.

For more information about authentication, check out the [github wiki page](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-jupyter/wiki#authenticate-to-power-bi-and-acquire-an-access-token).

## Create a Quick visualize instance

Create a `QuickVisualize` instance from the [data frame you created](#create-a-pandas-data-frame). Use the `get_dataset_config` utility method to help create a [`dataset_create_config`](/javascript/api/powerbi/powerbi-models/idatasetcreateconfiguration) object from the pandas data frame. If you're using a data frame other than pandas, you need to of parsing the data yourself.

```python
# Create quick visualization instance
qv = QuickVisualize(get_dataset_config(df), auth=auth)
```

## Render the visualization

Embed the quick create experience of generating quick visualizations based on the user’s data. The user can edit the visuals and save them. For more information, see [Interact with autogenerated "quick" reports in the Power BI service](../../create-reports/service-interact-quick-report.md).

## Set size of the container (optional)

Finally, you can define the size of he container.
