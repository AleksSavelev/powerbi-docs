# What is the Power BI embedded analytics playground?

The [Power BI embedded analytics playground](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848279) makes it easy for you to learn, explore, and try out Power BI embedded analytics. Itâ€™s also where you can keep up with all the new features and updates of Power BI embedded.

The playground gives you hands-on coding experience, and lets you embed your own reports, and interact with Power BI client APIs giving you instant results.
The playground has the following main experiences:

* [Developer sandbox](#developer-sandbox)
* [Explore our APIs](#explore-our-apis)
* [Showcases](#showcases)
* [Learning center](#learning-center)

## Developer sandbox

Go to the developer sandbox for hands-on experience using our client APIs. You can use the APIs with our sample report or with your own report.

Drag and drop code snippets into the report, or type them directly into the code editor area to see how they work.

## Showcases

The interactive showcases let you see how to apply these features in your applications. Each showcase presents an application that demonstrates what you can do with one or more of the client APIs.

The showcases code is open-sourced, and you can find the code behind all of them in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerBI-Embedded-Showcases/).

## Learning center

The Learning center is a collection of Power BI embedded analytics resources. It's where you can dive into our documentation, learn about our APIs, find our developer samples and videos, and learn where to get help.
