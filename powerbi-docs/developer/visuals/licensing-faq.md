# Transactability and License management FAQ

This article answers some of the questions users often have about how to set up, pay for, and manage licenses for custom Power BI visuals that they purchase from [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).

## License assignment

### How can I pay for the visuals?

Anyone can complete the checkout path in [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), and pay for the licenses with a credit card.  

If you're a billing or global admin of the tenant, you also have the option of paying through Invoicing.

### What happens if the subscription owner leaves the company?

Even if the owner of the subscription leaves the company, tenant admin purchases (typically known as Org purchases) will continue to work as-is. Any license admin (Global Admin, License Admin, User Admin) can manage the licenses. The subscriptions can be managed by any Billing Admin or Global Admin with access to the billing account used for purchase.

### Who can assign licenses after the purchase is complete?

If the tenant admin owns the licenses (Org licenses), then any of the license admins (Global Admin, License Admin or User Admin) can manage the licenses.  
However, if the subscription owner isn't an admin, then only the purchaser can manage the subscription and licenses.

### Can I sign in to Microsoft 365 admin center even if I'm not an admin?

When you purchase a Power BI Visual subscription, you also get access to the Microsoft 365 admin center, and can manage subscription from there.

### Do I have to assign a license to myself even if I'm the owner?

Yes. Any user who wants to use the offer should be assigned a license, even if they own the subscription.

### How do we assign the licenses?

Go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and select the **License** link under the **Billing** node from the menu. A list of visuals will appear.

### As an admin can I see the subscriptions that were purchased in my organization?
