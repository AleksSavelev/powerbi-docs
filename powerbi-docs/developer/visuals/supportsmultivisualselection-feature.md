# Apply a selection to multiple visuals in a report

The `supportsMultiVisualSelection` feature enables you to select values from one visual in a Power BI report and apply the selected values to all the visuals in that report.

For example, in the **Overview** page of the [Retail Analysis sample](../../create-reports/sample-retail-analysis.md), select **Fashions Direct** from **Chain** in one visual. Select **Jan** from **FiscalMonth** in another visual.

| Select *chain* from one visual  | Select *month* from another visual  |
|---|---|

In the report, these selections apply to all visuals that support this feature. The visuals will now scope to **Fashions Direct** and **January**.

## Enable the *support multiple visual selection* feature

To use the `supportsMultiVisualSelection` feature, add the following code to the *capabilities.json* file of your visual:

```json
    {   
            ...
        "supportsMultiVisualSelection": true
            ...
    }
```

## Considerations and limitations

* This feature requires API v3.2.0 or higher.
* This feature doesn't apply to image visuals.
* This feature doesn't apply to certain advanced visuals, such as key driver, decomposition tree, Q&A, textbox, and gauge chart visuals.
