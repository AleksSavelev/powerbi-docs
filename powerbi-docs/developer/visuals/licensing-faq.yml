You can also assign licenses to other users in your organization.

    questions:
      - question: |
          Who can assign licenses after the purchase is complete?
        answer: |
          The person who buys the visual is the owner, and only the owner can assign licenses. 
          
          > [!NOTE]
          > After buying the visual, the owner is automatically assigned a license, though [it might take a few minutes for the license to be available](#once-i-assign-a-license-how-long-does-it-take-until-i-can-use-it-). 

          If the tenant admin owns the licenses (Org licenses), then any of the license admins (Global Admin, License Admin or User Admin) can manage the licenses.  
          However, if the license owner isn't an admin, then only the purchaser/owner can manage the subscription and licenses.

      - question: |
          Once I assign a license, how long does it take until I can use it?
        answer: |
          > [!NOTE]
          > After you assign a license in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, the license should be available within a few minutes.
          
          If you were just assigned a license and don't see it, try the following:
          
           * If you're using the licensed visual in the Power BI Service, refresh the report by hitting <kbd>F5</kbd>.
           * If you're using the licensed visual in the Power BI Desktop, close and reopen it.
          
           If, after you refresh, the license is still not available, wait a while and try again. It could take up to five minutes.

      - question: |
          Can I sign in to Microsoft 365 admin center even if I'm not an admin?
        answer: |
          When you purchase a Power BI Visual subscription, you also get access to the Microsoft 365 admin center, and can manage subscription from there.

      - question: |
          Do I have to assign a license to myself even if I'm the owner?
        answer: |
          No. Buyers get a license assigned to them automatically. It can take up to five minutes from th time of purchase for the license to take effect. If you want to add more users or update your subscription, go to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

      - question: |
          How do we assign the licenses?
        answer: |
          Only the buyer (owner) can assign a license. You receive a license automatically within five minutes of purchasing the visual. If you want to assign a license to other users or update your subscription, go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and select the **License** link under the **Billing** node from the menu. A list of visuals appears.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/licensing-faq/assign-licenses.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Admin homepage with billing licenses selected.":::

           Select the Visual you want to assign licenses for. In the next page, select the user(s) you want to assign the licenses to.

      - question: |
          As an admin can I see the subscriptions that were purchased in my organization?
        answer: |
          A tenant admin can see all subscriptions purchased under the tenant account, including the subscriptions purchased by non-admins.

      - question: |
          What happens if the subscription owner leaves the company?
        answer: |
          Even if the owner of the subscription leaves the company, tenant admin purchases (typically known as Org purchases) continue to work as-is. Any license admin (Global Admin, License Admin, User Admin) can manage the licenses. The subscriptions can be managed by any Billing Admin or Global Admin with access to the billing account used for purchase.
          
      - question: |
          We're a global team. Can we assign licenses to someone working in another country?
        answer: |
          You can assign licenses to users in the same tenant that you purchased subscription under regardless of the location.

      - question: |
          As an admin, can I cancel offer purchase from AppSource?
        answer: |
          As a billing or global admin, you can see all subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and you can cancel them.

      - question: |
          How can I get more help or support for managing licenses?
        answer: |
          For help with buying a visual, go to [What is the Microsoft commercial marketplace](/marketplace//purchase-software-appsource).  
          For help with assigning a license, go to [Overview of the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview)
