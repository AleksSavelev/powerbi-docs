    questions:
      - question: |
          What happens if the subscription owner leaves the company?
        answer: |
          Even if the owner of the subscription leaves the company, tenant admin purchases (typically known as Org purchases) will continue to work as-is. Any license admin (Global Admin, License Admin, User Admin) can manage the licenses. The subscriptions can be managed by any Billing Admin or Global Admin with access to the billing account used for purchase.

      - question: |
          Who can assign licenses after the purchase is complete?
        answer: |
          If the tenant admin owns the licenses (Org licenses), then any of the license admins (Global Admin, License Admin or User Admin) can manage the licenses.  
          However, if the subscription owner isn't an admin, then only the purchaser can manage the subscription and licenses.

      - question: |
          Can I sign in to Microsoft 365 admin center even if I'm not an admin?
        answer: |
          When you purchase a Power BI Visual subscription, you also get access to the Microsoft 365 admin center, and can manage subscription from there.

      - question: |
          Do I have to assign a license to myself even if I'm the owner?
        answer: |
          No. Buyers get a license assigned to them automatically. If you want to add more users or update your subscription, go to the [admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).

      - question: |
          How do we assign the licenses?
        answer: |
          Go to [admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and select the **License** link under the **Billing** node from the menu. A list of visuals will appear.

           Select the Visual you want to assign licenses for. In the next page, select the user(s) you want to assign the licenses to.

      - question: |
          Once I assign a license, how long does it take until I can use it?
        answer: |
          After you are assigned a license in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center, it should be available within a few minutes.

          * If you're using the licensed visual in the Power BI Service, refresh the report by hitting F5.
          * If you're using the licensed visual in the Power BI Desktop, close and reopen it.

          If, after you refresh, the license is still not available, wait a while and try again. It could take up to a five minutes.

      - question: |
          As an admin can I see the subscriptions that were purchased in my organization?
        answer: |
          A tenant admin can see all subscriptions purchased under the tenant account, including the subscriptions purchased by non-admins.

      - question: |
          We're a global team. Can we assign licenses to someone working in another country?
        answer: |
          You can assign licenses to users in the same tenant that you purchased subscription under regardless of the country.

      - question: |
          As an admin, can I cancel offer purchase from AppSource?
        answer: |
          As a billing or global admin, you can see all subscriptions in the Microsoft 365 admin center, and you can cancel them.
