# Authentication API

The Authentication API enables visuals to obtain Microsoft Entra ID (formally known as Azure AD) access tokens for signed-in users, facilitating single sign-on authentication.

Power BI admins can enable or disable the API through a [global switch](/fabric/admin/organizational-visuals). The default setting is Off.

The API is applicable only for AppSource visuals, providing enhanced security and control. Visuals that are under development can be tested in debug mode before they're published.

## Supported environments

The following environments are supported:

* Web
* Desktop
* RS Desktop
* Mobile

## Unsupported environments

The following environments aren't yet supported:

* Sovereign clouds
* RS Service
* Embedded
* Teams (Microsoft Entra ID dialogs aren't supported in Teams)

## How to use the Authentication API

In the *capabilities.json* file, add the "AADAuthentication" privilege with your Microsoft Entra ID registered application URI:

```json
"privileges": [
    {
        "name": "AADAuthentication",
        "parameters": [
            "https://contoso.com"
        ]
    }
]
```

In the *pbiviz.json* file, set the API version to 5.7.0 or higher:

The newly exposed **AcquireAADTokenService** contains two methods:

* **acquireAADToken**: Returns the token for the visual or null if it can't be fetched.
* **acquireAADTokenstatus**: Returns one of the following privilege statuses associated with acquiring the token.

  * *Allowed*: The privilege is allowed in the current environment.
  * *NotDeclared*: The privilege declaration is missing in visual capabilities section.
  * *NotSupported*: The privilege isn't supported in the current environment.
  * *DisabledByAdmin*: The tenant administrator denied privilege usage.

The following sample code demonstrates how to acquire a Microsoft Entra ID token using the API:

```typescript
// Step 1: Check the status of AAD token acquisition
const acquireTokenStatus = await this.acquireAADTokenService.acquireAADTokenStatus();
 
// Step 2: Verify if acquiring the token is allowed
if (acquireTokenStatus === PrivilegeStatus.Allowed) {
 
    // Step 3: Acquire the AAD token
    const { accessToken }: AcquireAADTokenResult = await this.acquireAADTokenService.acquireAADToken();
 
    // Step 4: Confirm successful acquisition of the access token
    if (accessToken) {
 
        // Step 5: Call your backend API with the obtained token
    }
}
 
// Step 6: Handle unsuccessful AAD token acquisition
```

## Considerations and limitations

Authentication is blocked if any of the following conditions apply:â€‹

* The tenant switch is turned off.

* The user isn't signed in (in Desktop).

* The admin or user didn't give consent.

* The ISV didn't preauthorize the Power BI application.

* The format of the AADAuthentication Privilege parameter is invalid.

* The visual isn't publicly approved and isn't in Debug Visual mode.
