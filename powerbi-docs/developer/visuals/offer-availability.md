# Define the availability of a Power BI visuals offer

This page lets you define where and how to make your offer available, including markets and release date.

## Markets

To specify the markets in which your offer should be available, select **Show options**.

Your selections here apply only to new acquisitions; if someone already has your app in a certain market, and you later remove that market, the people who already have the offer in that market can continue to use it, but no new customers in that market will be able to get your offer.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>It is your responsibility to meet any local legal requirements, even if those requirements aren't listed here or in Partner Center. Even if you select all markets, local laws, restrictions, or other factors may prevent certain offers from being listed in some countries and regions.
