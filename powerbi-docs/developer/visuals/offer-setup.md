# Submit an offer to AppSource

This page describes some details about your Power BI visual offer including if you want it to be certified and if it requires purchasing a service.

## *Free* and *for purchase* Power BI visuals

You can submit Power BI visuals to be available to the marketplace for free, or you can also submit Power BI visuals that will have an additional purchase may be required tag. Visuals with the additional purchase may be required designation are similar to in-app purchase (IAP) add-ins in the [Office Store](office-store.md).
An IAP Power BI visual is a free visual that offers free features. It also has some advanced features that are available for a fee. In the Power BI visual's description, developers must notify users about the features that require additional purchases to operate.

## Certify your visual

Certified Power BI visuals are visuals in the Marketplace that meet certain specified code [requirements](power-bi-custom-visuals-certified.md#certification-requirements) that the Microsoft Power BI team has tested and approved. To request certification, select the Request Power BI certification check box. We recommend that you submit and publish your Power BI visual before you request certification, because the certification process can take time. When you request certification, be sure to provide all required certification information in the Notes for certification box on the Review and publish page. All certified visuals must pass all the [required tests](submission-testing.md).

1. Check the appropriate box under the Additional purchases heading.
2. If you want to certify your visual, check the Request Power BI certification check box. Certification is optional.

    >[!TIP]
    >The Power BI certification process takes time. If you're creating a new Power BI visual, we recommend that you publish your Power BI visual via the Partner Center before you request Power BI certification. This ensures that the publishing of your visual is not delayed.
