# Configure Power BI visual offer listing details

This page lets you define the offer details such as offer name, description, links, contacts, logos, and screenshots that will appear on Microsoft AppSource. These details can be provided in different languages.

## Languages

The default language for the offer listing details is English. You can add more languages by selecting Manage Additional languages. The offer listing details must be filled out for each language listed.
