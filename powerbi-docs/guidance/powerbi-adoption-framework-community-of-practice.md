# Power BI adoption framework: Community of practice

A community of practice includes a group of people with a common interest, who interact with and help each other on a voluntary basis. Using Power BI to produce effective analytics is a common interest that can bring people together across an organization.

The following visual provides an overview of an internal community:

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-adoption-framework-community-of-practice/powerbi-adoption-framework-community-of-practice.png" alt-text="Image shows the community relationships between the C O E, creators, champions, and consumers, which are described next.":::

The above diagram depicts the following:

- The **community of practice** includes everyone with an interest in Power BI.
- The **Center of Excellence** forms the nucleus of the community. The COE oversees the entire community and interacts most closely with the champions.
- **Self-service content creators and subject matter experts** produce, publish, and support content that is used by their colleagues (the consumers).
- **Content consumers** view content produced by both self-service creators and enterprise BI developers.
- **Champions** are a subset of the self-service content creators. This puts champions in an excellent position to support their fellow content creators in generating more effective Power BI solutions.
- Champions are the smallest group among creators and SMEs. Self-service content creators and subject matter experts are a larger number of people. Content consumers represent the largest number of people.

> [!TIP]
> All references to the Power BI community in this adoption series refers to users internal to the organization (unless explicitly stated otherwise). There is an active and vibrant worldwide community of bloggers and presenters that produce a wealth of knowledge about Power BI. However, internal users are the focus of this article.

See the [mentoring and user enablement](powerbi-adoption-framework-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md) article about related topics including resources, documentation, and training provided for the Power BI community.

## Champions network

One important part of a community of practice is its champions. Typically, a champion is a Power BI content creator who works in a business unit that engages with the COE. A champion is known as the "go-to" Power BI expert by their peers. A champion continually builds and shares their knowledge even if it is not an official part of their job responsibilities. Power BI champions are extremely influential and helpful to their colleagues in a lot of ways such as solution development, learning, skills improvement, troubleshooting, and keeping up to date.

Champions emerge as leaders of the community of practice who:

- Have a deep interest in Power BI being used effectively and adopted successfully throughout the organization
- Possess Power BI acumen as well as domain knowledge for their functional business unit
- Have an inherent interest in being involved and helping others
- Are early adopters who are enthusiastic about experimenting and learning
- Can effectively translate business needs into solutions
- Communicate well with colleagues

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some organizations call their champions network something like ambassadors, jedis, ninjas, or rangers to bring an element of fun. Microsoft has an internal community called BI Champs.

Most often, people are not directly asked to become champions. More commonly, champions are identified by the COE and recognized for the activities they are already doing (such as frequently answering questions in an internal discussion channel or participating in lunch and learns).

Different approaches will be more effective for different organizations, and each organization will find what works best for them as their maturity level increases.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Someone very well may be acting in the role of a champion without even knowing it, and without a formal designation. The COE is always on the lookout for champions. Members of the COE should actively monitor the discussion channel to see who is helpful, deliberately encourage and support them, and as appropriate invite them into a champions network to make the recognition more formal.

## Knowledge sharing

The overall objective of a community of practice is to facilitate knowledge sharing among colleagues and across organizational boundaries.

There are a lot of ways knowledge sharing occurs. It could be during the normal course of work. Or, it could be during a more structured activity, such as:

| **Activity** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Discussion channel | A Q&amp;A forum where anyone in the community can post and view messages. Used most often for help and announcements. See the internal community support section of the [user support](powerbi-adoption-framework-user-support.md) article for further discussion. |
| Lunch and learn sessions | Regularly scheduled sessions where someone presents a short session about something they've learned or a solution they've created. The goal is to get a variety of presenters involved, because it's a powerful message to hear what colleagues have been able to achieve firsthand. |
| Office hours with the COE | Regularly scheduled times when COE staff are available so members of the community can engage with experts from the COE and receive assistance with minimal process overhead. See the mentoring and user enablement article for further discussion. |
| Internal blog posts or wiki posts | Short blog posts, usually covering technical how-to topics. |
| Internal Power BI user group | A subset of the community which chooses to meet as a group on a regularly scheduled basis. User group members often take turns presenting to each other to share knowledge and improve their presentation skills. |
| Internal Power BI conferences or events | Annual or semi-annual internal conference with a series of sessions focused on Power BI. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Inviting an external presenter can reduce the effort level and bring a fresh viewpoint for learning and knowledge sharing.

## Incentives

A lot of effort goes into forming and sustaining a successful community. It's advantageous to everyone to empower and reward users who work for the benefit of the community.

### Rewarding community members

Incentives that the entire community (including champions) find particularly rewarding can include:

- **Contests with a small gift card or time off.** For example, you might hold a performance tuning event with the winner being the person who successfully reduced the size of their data model the most.
- **Ranking based on help points.** The more frequently someone participates in Q&amp;A, they achieve a change in status with a leaderboard. This type of gamification promotes healthy competition for anyone to participate more in the internal discussion forum. By getting involved in more conversations, the person participating learns and grows personally in addition to helping their peers.
- **Leadership communication**. Reach out to a manager when someone goes above and beyond so that their leadership (who may not be active in the Power BI community) sees the value that their staff provide.

> [!TIP]
> Different types of incentives will appeal to different types of people. Some community members will be highly motivated by praise and feedback. Others will be inspired by gamification and a bit of fun. Whereas others will highly value the opportunity to improve their level of knowledge.

### Rewarding champions

Incentives that champions find particularly rewarding can include:

- **More direct access to the COE**. The ability to have "connections" in the COE is valuable. This is depicted in the diagram shown at the beginning of this article.
- **Champion of the month**. Publicly thank one of your champions for something specific that they did particularly well during the previous month. This could be a fun tradition at the beginning of a monthly lunch and learn, for instance.
- **A private experts discussion area**. A private area for the champions to share ideas and learn from each other will be very valued.
- **Specialized or deep dive information and training**. Access to additional information to help champions grow their skillsets (as well as help their colleagues) will be appreciated.

## Communication plan

Communication with the community occurs through various types of communication channels. Common communication channels include:

- Internal discussion channel or forum
- Announcements channel
- Organizational newsletter

The most critical communication objectives include ensuring your community members know that:

- The Center of Excellence exists
- How to get help and support
- Where to find resources and documentation
- Where to find governance guidelines
- How to share suggestions and ideas

> [!TIP]
> Consider requiring a simple "Power BI test" before a user is granted a Power BI license. This "test" is a misnomer as it does not focus on any Power BI skills. Rather, it verifies that the user knows where to find help and resources. It sets them up for success. It's also a great opportunity to have users acknowledge any governance policies or data privacy and protection agreements you need them to be aware of. See the system oversight article for additional discussion.

### Types of communication

There are generally four types of communication to plan for:

1. **New employee communications**. This type of communication is directed to new employees (and contractors). For new employees who are expected to work with data, this is an excellent opportunity to provide onboarding materials they need to get started with Power BI. This includes items such as how to get Power BI Desktop installed, how to request a license, and where to find introductory training materials. This can also include general data governance guidelines all users should be aware of.
2. **Onboarding communications**. This type of communication is directed to employees who are just acquiring a Power BI license or getting involved with the Power BI community. This presents an excellent opportunity to provide the same type of materials as mentioned above for new employee communications.
3. **Ongoing communications**. This type of communication includes regular announcements and updates directed to all Power BI users, or subsets of users. This includes announcing changes happening to key organizational content. For example, changes are being published for a critical shared dataset that is used heavily throughout the organization. This also includes announcing new features from the [blog](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/) and [release plan](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/roadmap/) updates (see the [system oversight](powerbi-adoption-framework-system-oversight.md) article for further discussion about planning for change). Feature announcements are more likely to get attention from the reader if the message includes additional meaningful context about why it's important. (Although an RSS feed is a helpful technique, with the frequent pace of change it can become noisy and mostly ignored.)
4. **Situational communications**. This type of communication is directed to specific users or groups based on a specific occurrence discovered while [monitoring the platform](powerbi-adoption-framework-system-oversight.md#auditing-and-monitoring). For instance, perhaps you're seeing a significant amount of sharing out of "my workspace" for a particular user, so you choose to send them some information about the benefits of workspaces and apps.

> [!TIP]
> One-way communication to the user community is important. Don't forget to also include bidirectional communication options to ensure the user community has an opportunity to provide feedback when appropriate.

## Community resources

Resources for the internal community, such as documentation, templates, and training, are critical for adoption success. Resources are discussed in the [mentoring and user enablement](powerbi-adoption-framework-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md) article.

## Considerations and key actions

Considerations and key actions you can take to initiate, grow, and sustain your champions network:

- Clarify your specific goals for cultivating a champions network. Make sure these goals align with your overall Power BI strategy, and that your executive sponsor is on board.
- Create a plan for supporting the champions network. Although some aspects of a champions network will always be informally led, determine to what extent the COE will purposefully cultivate and support the efforts of champions throughout the individual business units.
- Decide what level of commitment and expected time investment will be required of Power BI champions (note that the time investment can vary wildly from person to person, and team to team). Plan to clearly communicate this to people who are interested in getting involved. Arrange to obtain manager approval when appropriate.
- Determine how you will respond to requests to become a champion, and how the COE will seek out champions. Decide if you will openly encourage interested employees to self-identify as a champion and ask to learn more (less common), or if the COE will more subtly observe efforts and extend the invitation privately (more common).
- Consider how many champions is ideal per functional business area. Usually, 1-2 champions per area works well but this can vary based on the size of the team, the needs of the self-service community, and how the [COE is structured](powerbi-adoption-framework-center-of-excellence.md#structuring-a-coe).
- Determine how members of the champions network will be managed. This could be implemented through membership in a security group. Consider:
  - How you will communicate with the champions network (for instance, in a Teams channel, a Yammer group, and/or email group)
  - How the champions network will communicate and collaborate with each other directly (across organizational boundaries)
  - If a private discussion forum for champions and COE members only is appropriate
- Ensure the champions have the resources they need, including:
  - Direct access to COE personnel
  - Influence on data policies being implemented (for example, what the requirements are for a dataset certification policy)
  - Influence on best practices and guidance being shared with the broader community (for example, what the recommendations are for accessing a specific source system)
- Actively involve certain champions as satellite members of the COE. See the [Center of Excellence article](powerbi-adoption-framework-center-of-excellence.md#structuring-a-coe) for further discussion about federating the COE.
- Create a feedback loop for champions to easily provide information or suggestions to the COE.
- Routinely provide recognition and incentives for people in your champions network. Not only is praise an effective motivator, but the act of sharing examples of successful efforts can be used as a how-to for others in the organization which extends learnings across organizational boundaries.

Considerations and key actions you can take improve knowledge sharing:

- Determine what kind of activities for knowledge sharing fit well into the organizational data culture.
- Ensure that all planned knowledge sharing activities are supportable and sustainable.
- Verify who will take responsibility for coordinating all knowledge sharing activities.

Considerations and key actions you can take to introduce incentives:

- Consider what type of incentives you could offer to your champions network, and to your broader internal community.

Considerations and key actions you can take improve communications:

- Evaluate which methods of communication fit well in your data culture.
- Determine who will be responsible for what types of communication, how, and when.
- Set up different ways to communicate, including history retention and search where appropriate.

## Maturity levels

The following maturity levels will help you assess the current state of your community of practice:

| **Level** | **State of Power BI community** |
| --- | --- |
| 100: Initial | Some content creators are doing great work, but their efforts are unrecognized.</br></br>Efforts to share knowledge are rare and unstructured.</br></br>Communications are inconsistent. |
| 200: Repeatable | The first set of champions are identified, and goals for a champions network are established.</br></br>Knowledge sharing practices are gaining traction and becoming more consistent. |
| 300: Defined | Best practices are actively shared across the organization.</br></br>Knowledge sharing in multiple forms is a normal, regularly scheduled, occurrence.</br></br>Goals for transparent communication with the user community are defined and executed with regularity. |
| 400: Capable | Champions are established for all business units and are actively supporting colleagues in their self-service efforts.</br></br>Incentives to recognize and reward knowledge sharing efforts are a common occurrence.</br></br>Regular communication occurs based on a predefined communication plan. |
| 500: Efficient | Bidirectional feedback loops exist between the champions network and the COE. |
