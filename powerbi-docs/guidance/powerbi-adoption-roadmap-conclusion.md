## Power BI implementation planning

Successfully implementing Power BI throughout the organization requires deliberate thought and planning. The [Power BI implementation planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-introduction.md) series of articles, which is a work in progress, is intended to complement the Power BI adoption roadmap. It will include key considerations, actions, decision-making criteria, recommendations, and it will describe implementation patterns for important common usage scenarios.

## Power BI adoption framework

The [Power BI adoption framework](https://github.com/pbiaf/powerbiadoption) describes additional aspects of *how* to adopt Power BI in more detail. The original intent of the framework was to support Microsoft partners with a lightweight set of resources for use when helping their customers deploy and adopt Power BI.

The framework can augment this Power BI adoption roadmap series. The roadmap series focuses on the *why* and *what* of adopting Power BI, more so than the *how*.

> [!NOTE]
> When completed, the Power BI implementation planning series (described in the previous section) will replace the Power BI adoption framework.

## Enterprise deployment whitepaper

The [Planning a Power BI enterprise deployment](https://aka.ms/PBIEnterpriseDeploymentWP) whitepaper provides a comprehensive overview for Power BI implementers. Its primary goal is awareness of options, key considerations, decisions, and best practices. Because of the breadth of content, different sections of the whitepaper will appeal to managers, IT professionals, and self-service authors.

The whitepaper goes deeper into the *what* and *how* of adopting Power BI, with a strong focus on technology. When you've finished reading the series of Power BI adoption articles, the whitepaper will fill you in with extra information to help put your plans into action.

> [!NOTE]
> The Enterprise deployment whitepaper won't be updated again. When completed, the Power BI implementation planning series (described in the previous section) will replace the Enterprise deployment whitepaper.

## Microsoft's BI transformation

Consider reading about [Microsoft's journey and experience with driving a data culture](center-of-excellence-microsoft-business-intelligence-transformation.md). This article describes the importance of two terms: *discipline at the core* and *flexibility at the edge*. It also shares Microsoft's views and experience about the importance of establishing a COE.

## Power Platform adoption

The Power Platform team has an excellent set of adoption-related content. Its primary focus is on Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. Many of the ideas presented in this content can be applied to Power BI also.

The [Power CAT Adoption Maturity Model](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/power-cat-adoption-maturity-model-repeatable-patterns-for-successful-power-platform-adoption/), published by the Power CAT team, describes repeatable patterns for successful Power Platform adoption.

The [Power Platform Center of Excellence Starter Kit](/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit) is a collection of components and tools to help you develop a strategy for adopting and supporting Microsoft Power Platform.

The [Power Platform adoption best practices](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/methodology) includes a helpful set of documentation and best practices to help you align business and technical strategies.

The [Power Platform adoption framework](https://github.com/PowerPlatformAF/PowerPlatformAF/wiki) is a community-driven project with excellent resources on adoption of Power Platform services at scale.
