# Power BI adoption framework overview

The goal for this series of articles is to provide a technical roadmap: a series of strategic and tactical considerations and action items which will directly lead to successful Power BI adoption, and help build a data culture in your organization.

Advancing adoption and cultivating a data culture is about more than implementing technology features. Technology can assist an organization in making the greatest impact, but a healthy data culture involves a lot of considerations across the spectrum of people, processes, and technology.

This series of articles correlates with the following Power BI adoption roadmap diagram:

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-adoption-framework-overview/powerbi-adoption-framework-overview-roadmap.png" alt-text="Image shows a diagram depicting the 10 high-level areas of Power B I adoption, which are described in the table below.":::

The areas in the above diagram include:

| **Item** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ![Item 1.](media/common/icon-01-red-30x30.png) | **Data culture:** Data culture refers to a set of behaviors and norms in the organization which encourages a data-driven culture. Building a data culture is closely related to adopting Power BI and is often a key aspect of an organization's digital transformation. |
| ![Item 2.](media/common/icon-02-red-30x30.png) | **Executive sponsor:** An executive sponsor is someone with credibility, influence, and authority throughout the organization to advocate for building a data culture and adopting Power BI. |
| ![Item 3.](media/common/icon-03-red-30x30.png) | **Content ownership and management:** There are three primary strategies for how business intelligence content is owned and managed: business-led self-service BI, managed self-service BI, and enterprise BI. These strategies have a significant influence on adoption, governance, and the Center of Excellence operating model. |
| ![Item 4.](media/common/icon-04-red-30x30.png) | **Content delivery scope:** There are four primary strategies for content delivery including personal BI, team BI, departmental BI, and enterprise BI. These strategies have a significant influence on adoption, governance, and the Center of Excellence operating model. |
| ![Item 5.](media/common/icon-05-red-30x30.png) | **Center of Excellence:** A Power BI Center of Excellence (COE) is an internal team of technical and business experts who actively assist others within the organization who are working with data. The COE forms the nucleus of the broader community that advances adoption goals which align with the data culture vision. |
| ![Item 6.](media/common/icon-06-red-30x30.png) | **Governance:** Data governance is a set of policies and procedures that define the ways in which an organization wants data to be used. The goal of governance when adopting Power BI is to empower the internal user community to the extent possible, while adhering to industry, governmental, and contractual requirements and regulations. |
| ![Item 7.](media/common/icon-07-red-30x30.png) | **Mentoring and user enablement:** A critical objective for adoption efforts is to enable users to accomplish as much as they can within the guardrails established by governance guidelines and policies. The act of mentoring users is one of the most important responsibilities of the COE and has a direct influence on adoption efforts. |
| ![Item 8.](media/common/icon-08-red-30x30.png) | **Community of practice:** A community of practice includes a group of people with a common interest, who interact with and help each other on a voluntary basis. An active community is an indicator of a healthy data culture and can significantly advance adoption efforts. |
| ![Item 9.](media/common/icon-09-red-30x30.png) | **User support:** User support includes both informally organized, and formally organized, methods of resolving issues and answering questions. Both formal and informal support methods are critical for adoption. |
| ![Item 10.](media/common/icon-10-red-30x30.png) | **System oversight:** System oversight includes the day-to-day administration responsibilities to support the internal processes, tools, and people. |

The relationships in the diagram shown above can be summarized as follows:

Your organizational **data culture** vision will strongly influence the strategies that you follow for self-service and enterprise **content ownership and management** and **content delivery scope**. These strategies will, in turn, have a big impact on the operating model for your **Center of Excellence** and governance decisions. The established **governance** guidelines, policies, and processes affect the implementation methods used for **mentoring and enablement** , the **community of practice** , and **user support**. Governance decisions will dictate the day-to-day **system oversight** (administration) activities. All data culture and adoption-related decisions and actions are accomplished more easily with guidance and leadership from an **executive sponsor**.

Each individual article discusses key topics associated with an area of the diagram. Considerations and potential action items are provided. Each article concludes with a set of [maturity levels](powerbi-adoption-framework-maturity-levels.md) to help you assess your current state so you can decide what action to take.

## Power BI adoption

Power BI adoption references the organization's state of having effective processes, support, tools, and data available and integrated into regular ongoing patterns of usage for content creators, consumers, and stakeholders in the organization.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This series of adoption articles is focused on _**organizational**_ adoption. See the [Power BI adoption maturity levels article](powerbi-adoption-framework-maturity-levels.md) for an introduction to the three types of adoption: organizational, user, and solution.

A common misconception is that adoption relates primarily to usage or number of users. There's no question that usage statistics are an important factor. However, usage is not the only factor. Adoption is not just about _using_ the technology on a regular basis; it's about using it _effectively_. Effectiveness is much harder to define and measure.

Whenever possible, adoption efforts should be aligned across analytics platforms, BI services, and other technologies in the Power Platform such as Power Apps and Power Automate.

> [!NOTE]
> Individuals—and the organization itself—are continually learning, changing, and improving which means there's no formal end to adoption-related efforts.

The remaining articles in this Power BI adoption series will discuss the following aspects of adoption:

- [Adoption maturity levels](powerbi-adoption-framework-maturity-levels.md)
- [Data culture](powerbi-adoption-framework-data-culture.md)
- [Executive sponsorship](powerbi-adoption-framework-executive-sponsorship.md)
- [Content ownership and management](powerbi-adoption-framework-content-ownership-and-management.md)
- [Content delivery scope](powerbi-adoption-framework-content-delivery-scope.md)
- [Center of Excellence](powerbi-adoption-framework-center-of-excellence.md)
- [Governance](powerbi-adoption-framework-governance.md)
- [Mentoring and enablement](powerbi-adoption-framework-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md)
- [Community of practice](powerbi-adoption-framework-community-of-practice.md)
- [User support](powerbi-adoption-framework-user-support.md)
- [System oversight](powerbi-adoption-framework-system-oversight.md)
- [Conclusion and additional resources](powerbi-adoption-framework-conclusion.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You may be wondering how this Power BI adoption roadmap is different from the [Power BI adoption framework](https://github.com/pbiaf/powerbiadoption). The adoption framework was created primarily to support Microsoft partners with a lightweight set of resources for use when helping their customers deploy and adopt Power BI. This Power BI adoption series that you're reading now is more current and is intended to be used directly by any person or organization using or considering using Power BI. If you're seeking to improve your existing Power BI implementation, or planning a new Power BI implementation, this adoption roadmap is the place to start. You will also find a lot of valuable information in the [Power BI adoption framework](https://github.com/pbiaf/powerbiadoption), so we encourage you to review it as well.

## Target audience

The reader for this series of articles on Power BI adoption is interested in one or more of the following:

- Improving the organization's ability to effectively use Power BI
- Increasing the organization's maturity level related to Power BI delivery
- Understanding and overcoming adoption-related challenges faced when scaling Power BI
- Increasing the organization's return on investments in data and analytics

Primarily, we expect this series of articles to be helpful to readers who work at an organization with one or more of the following characteristics:

- Power BI is deployed with some successes
- Power BI has pockets of viral adoption, but is not purposefully governed across the entire organization
- Power BI is deployed with some meaningful scale with a need to determine:
  - What is effective and should be maintained
  - What should be improved
  - How to be more strategic
- An expanded implementation of Power BI is being planned

Secondarily, this series of articles will also be helpful for:

- Organizations who are in the early stages of a Power BI implementation
- Organizations who have had success with adoption and want to evaluate their current maturity level

## Assumptions and scope

The primary focus for this series of articles is on the Power BI technology platform, with an emphasis on the Power BI service.

To get the most from this information, the reader should be aware of the [fundamental concepts](../fundamentals/power-bi-overview.md) and building blocks of Power BI.
