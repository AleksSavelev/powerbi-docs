## Workspaces

Workspace planning and implementation involves a variety of considerations.

See the [workspaces](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces.md) article for further information, as well as key decisions and actions for each topic.

### Tenant-level workspace planning

There are a few strategic planning considerations at the tenant-level. We recommend you handle the tenant-level workspace decisions as early as possible because they'll affect everything else. It's easier to make individual workspace decisions when you have clarity on the overall goals and objectives.

Topics to consider for [tenant-level workspace planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md) include:

- Workspace creation permissions
- Workspace naming conventions
- Workspace creation process
- Workspace governance level

### Workspace-level workspace planning

There are quite a few tactical decisions to be made at the individual workspace level. Individual workspace decisions should abide by tenant-level decisions when applicable.

Topics to consider for [workspace-level workspace planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-workspace-level-planning.md) include:

- Workspace purpose
  - Intent for collaboration
  - Intent for content viewing
  - Appropriate use of personal workspaces
- Workspace ownership
- Workspace organization
  - Workspace subject and scope
  - Workspace artifact types
- Workspace access
- Workspace settings
  - Workspace license type
  - Workspace settings
  - Workspace integration with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2)
  - Workspace integration with Azure Log Analytics
- Workspace auditing
