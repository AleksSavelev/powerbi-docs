# Power BI adoption roadmap: Center of Excellence

A Power BI Center of Excellence (COE) is an internal team of technical and business experts who actively assist others within the organization who are working with data. The COE forms the nucleus of the broader community that advances adoption goals which align with the data culture vision.

A COE might also be known as business intelligence competency center, capability center, or a center of expertise. Some organizations use other terms such as squads. Many organizations perform the COE responsibilities within their BI team or analytics team.

> [!NOTE]
> Formally having a COE team on your org chart is recommended, but not required. What's most important is that the roles and responsibilities of a COE are identified, prioritized, and assigned. It's common for a centralized BI or analytics team to take on many of the responsibilities of a COE; some responsibilities may also reside within IT. For simplicity, in this series of articles we'll refer to a COE as a specific group of people although you may implement it differently. It's also very common to implement the COE with a scope broader than Power BI alone: for instance, a Power Platform COE or an analytics COE.

## Goals for a COE

Goals for a Center of Excellence include:

- Evangelizing a data-driven culture
- Promoting adoption of Power BI
- Nurturing, mentoring, guiding, and educating internal users to increase their skill level and level of self-reliance
- Coordinating efforts and disseminating knowledge across organizational boundaries
- Creating consistency and transparency for the user community, which reduces friction and pain points for finding relevant data and analytics content
- Maximizing the benefits of self-service BI, while reducing the risks
- Reducing technical debt by helping make good decisions which increase consistency and have fewer inefficiencies

> [!IMPORTANT]
> One of the most powerful aspects of a COE is their cross-departmental view into how Power BI is really being used throughout the organization. Their ability to learn which practices work well, and which don't, can facilitate a bottom-up approach to governance. The goal is to learn which practices work well, share that knowledge more broadly, and replicate best practices across the organization.

## Scope of COE responsibilities

The scope of COE responsibilities can vary significantly between organizations. A COE can usually be thought of as a consultancy because the COE members routinely provide advice to others based on their expertise. Most COEs also take on hands-on work as well, to varying degrees.

Common responsibilities for a COE include:

- Mentoring the internal Power BI community (see the [community of practice](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-community-of-practice.md) article)
- Producing, curating, and promoting training materials (see the [mentoring and user enablement](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md) article)
- Creating documentation and resources to encourage standards and best practices (see the [mentoring and user enablement](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md) article)
- Applying, communicating, and assisting with governance guidelines (see the [governance](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-governance.md) article)
- Handling and assisting with system oversight and administration (see the [system oversight](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-system-oversight.md) article)
- Handling user support issues escalated from the help desk (see the [user support](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-user-support.md) article)
- Developing solutions and/or proofs of concept
- Establishing and maintaining the BI platform and data architecture

## Staffing a COE

People who are a good fit for staffing the COE tend to be those who:

- Understand the analytics vision for the organization
- Have a desire to continually improve analytics practices for the organization
- Have a deep interest in and expertise with Power BI
- Have a deep interest in Power BI being used effectively and adopted successfully throughout the organization
- Take the initiative to continually learn, adapt, and grow
- Readily share their knowledge with others
- Are interested in repeatable processes, standardization, and governance with a focus on user enablement
- Have a hyper-focus on collaboration with others
- Are comfortable working in an agile fashion
- Have an inherent interest in being involved and helping others
- Can effectively translate business needs into solutions
- Communicate well with both technical and business colleagues

> [!TIP]
> If you have Power BI creators in the organization constantly pushing the boundaries of what can be done, they might be a great candidate to be a champion (discussed in the [community of practice](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-community-of-practice.md) article) or perhaps even part of the COE.

When staffing the COE, it's important to have a mix of complementary analytical skills, technical skills, and business skills.

## Roles and responsibilities

Very generalized roles within a COE are shown below. It's common for multiple people to overlap on roles (which is useful from a backup and cross-training perspective). It's also very common for the same person to serve multiple roles (for instance, most COE personnel serve as a coach and it's not technically a separate person).

| **Role** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| COE leader | Manage the day-to-day operations of the COE. Interact with executive sponsor and other organizational teams (such as the data governance board) as necessary. See the [governance](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-governance.md) article for additional roles and responsibilities. |
| Coach | Coach and educate others on BI skills via office hours, best practices reviews, and co-development projects. Oversee and participate in the discussion channel in the internal community. Interact with and support champions network. |
| Trainer | Develop, curate, and deliver internal training materials, documentation, and resources. |
| Data analyst | Domain-specific subject matter expert. Liaison between the COE and the business unit. Content creator for the business unit. Assist with certification of content. Work on co-development projects and proof of concepts. |
| Data modeler | Create and manage shared datasets and dataflows to support self-service content creators. |
| Report creator | Create and publish data visualizations, reports, and dashboards. |
| Data engineer | Power BI deployment and architecture planning, including integration with Azure and other data platforms. Publish data assets which are utilized broadly across the organization. |
| User support | Assist with resolution of data discrepancies and escalated help desk support issues. |

As mentioned previously, the scope of responsibilities for a COE can vary quite a bit. Therefore, the roles found for staff within the COE will vary as well.

## Structuring a COE

How a COE is structured can vary among organizations. The four most common ways you could structure the COE are centralized, unified, federated, or decentralized. Additional variations exist as well.

The terms used below may be used slightly differently in your organization (particularly the meaning of "federated" which tends to be used different ways).

### Centralized COE

A centralized COE is comprised of a single shared services team.

**Pros:**

- There is a single point of accountability for a single team that manages standards, best practices, and delivery end-to-end.
- The COE is one area from an org chart perspective.
- It's easy to start with this approach and evolve to the unified or federated model over time.

**Cons:**

- A centralized team might have an authoritarian tendency to favor one-size-fits-all decisions that don't always work well for all business units.
- There can be a tendency to prefer IT skills over business skills.
- Due to the centralized nature, it may be more difficult for the COE staff to sufficiently understand the needs of all business units.

### Unified COE

A unified COE is a single, centralized, shared services team which has been expanded to also include embedded team members who are dedicated to supporting a specific functional area or business unit.

**Pros:**

- There is a single point of accountability for a single team which includes cross-functional involvement from the embedded COE team members who are assigned to various areas of the business.
- The COE is one area from an org chart perspective.
- The COE understands the needs of business units more deeply due to dedicated staff with domain expertise.

**Cons:**

- The embedded COE team members who are dedicated to a specific business unit have a different org chart responsibility than the people they serve directly within the business unit. This may potentially lead to complications, differences in priorities, or necessitate the involvement of your executive sponsor (who preferably has a scope of authority that includes the COE and all involved business units) for conflict resolution.

### Federated COE

A federated COE comprises a shared services team plus satellite members from each functional area or major business unit. A federated team is working in coordination although its members reside in different business units. Typically, the satellite members are primarily focused on development activities to support their business unit while the shared services personnel support the entire community.

**Pros:**

- There is cross-functional involvement from satellite COE members who represent their specific functional area and have domain expertise.
- There is a balance of centralized and decentralized representation with the core and satellite COE members.
- When distributed data ownership situations exist (i.e., business units take direct responsibility for data management activities), this model is effective.

**Cons:**

- A federated approach requires strong leadership, excellent communication, strong project management, and ultra-clear expectations since it involves core members plus satellite team members which span organizational boundaries.
- There is a higher risk of encountering competing priorities due to the federated structure.
- This approach typically involves part-time people and/or 'dotted-line' org chart accountability which can introduce competing time pressures.

### Decentralized COE

Decentralized COEs are independently managed by business units.

**Pros:**

- A specialized data culture exists which is focused on the business unit, which makes it easier to learn quickly and adapt.
- Policies and practices are tailored to each business unit.
- Agility, flexibility, and priorities are focused on the individual business unit.

**Cons:**

- There is a risk that decentralized COEs are operated in isolation and don't share best practices and lessons learned outside of their business unit.
- Collaboration with a centralized team may be informal and/or inconsistent.
- Policies become inconsistently created and applied across business units.
- It is difficult to scale a decentralized model.
- There is potential rework to bring one or more decentralized COEs in line with organizational-wide policies.
- Larger business units with significant funding may have more resources available to them, which may not serve cost optimization goals from an organization-wide perspective.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> A highly centralized COE tends to be more authoritarian, whereas highly decentralized COEs tend to be more siloed. Each organization will need to weigh the pros and cons that apply to them to determine the best choice for structure. For most organizations, the most effective approach tends to be the unified or federated approach (discussed above) which bridges organizational boundaries.

## Funding the COE

The COE may obtain its operating budget in multiple ways:

- Cost center
- Profit center with project budget(s)
- A combination of the above

When the COE operates as a cost center, it absorbs the operating costs. Generally, this involves an approved annual budget. Sometimes this is called a "push" engagement model.

When the COE operates as a profit center (for at least part of its budget), it could accept projects throughout the year based on funding from other business units. Sometimes this is called a "pull" engagement model.

Funding is important because it impacts the way that the COE communicates and engages with the internal community. As the COE experiences more and more successes, they may receive more requests from business units for help as awareness grows throughout the organization.

> [!TIP]
> The COE can more actively grow its influence and ability to help depending on its funding model. The funding model can also have a big impact on where authority resides and how decision-making works. It also impacts the type of services a COE can offer, such as co-development projects and/or best practices reviews which are discussed in the [mentoring and user enablement](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-mentoring-and-user-enablement.md) article.

Some organizations cover the COE operating costs with chargebacks to business units based on the usage metrics of Power BI. For shared capacity, this could be based on something like number of active users. For Premium capacity, chargebacks could be allocated based on which business units are using the capacity. Ideally, chargebacks can be directly correlated to the business value gained.

## Considerations and key actions

Considerations and key actions you can take to establish or improve your Power BI Center of Excellence:

- Define the scope of responsibilities for the COE. Once that is known, identify the skills and competencies required to fulfill those responsibilities.
- Analyze if the COE has the systems and infrastructure it needs in place to meet its goals and scope of responsibilities.
- Determine what COE structure is most appropriate (centralized, unified, federated, or decentralized). Verify the staffing, roles and responsibilities, and org chart (HR reporting) relationships which are required.
- Identify the internal customers, and any external customers, to be served by the COE and how the COE will generally engage with those customers (push model, pull model, or both).
- If starting out with a centralized or decentralized COE, consider how to scale the COE over time with the unified or federated approach, and if there are any actions to take now to facilitate that in the future.
- Verify the funding plan for the COE. Decide if the COE is purely a cost center with an operating budget, if it will operate partially as a profit center, and/or if chargebacks to other business units will be required.
- Create a [communications strategy](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-governance.md#governance-planning) for educating the Power BI community about what services the COE offers, and how to engage with the COE.

## Maturity levels

The following maturity levels will help you assess the current state of your Center of Excellence:

| **Level** | **State of Power BI Center of Excellence** |
| --- | --- |
| 100: Initial | One or more COEs exist, or the activities are being performed within the BI team or IT. There's not clarity on the specific goals nor expectations for responsibilities.</br></br>Requests for assistance from the COE are handled in an ad hoc manner. |
| 200: Repeatable | The COE is in place with a specific charter to mentor, guide, and educate self-service users. The COE seeks to maximize benefits of self-service BI while reducing the risks.</br></br>Goals, scope, staffing, structure, and funding are established for the COE. |
| 300: Defined | The COE operates with active involvement from all business units in a unified or federated mode. |
| 400: Capable | The goals for the COE align with organizational goals and are reassessed regularly.</br></br>The COE is well-known throughout the organization, and consistently proves its value to the internal user community. |
| 500: Efficient | Key performance indicators are measured and reviewed regularly to evaluate COE effectiveness.</br></br>Agility and implementing continual improvements from lessons learned are top priorities for the COE. |
