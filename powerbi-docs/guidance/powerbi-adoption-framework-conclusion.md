## Power BI adoption framework

While this adoption series focuses on the "why" and "what" of adopting Power BI and includes topics related to people, processes, and technology, the [Power BI adoption framework](https://github.com/pbiaf/powerbiadoption) discusses additional aspects of "how" to go about adopting Power BI in more detail. Its original intent was to support Microsoft partners with a lightweight set of resources for use when helping their customers deploy and adopt Power BI.

## Enterprise deployment whitepaper

The [Planning a Power BI enterprise deployment](https://aka.ms/PBIEnterpriseDeploymentWP) whitepaper is intended to be a comprehensive overview for implementers of Power BI. Its primary goal is awareness of options, key considerations, decisions, and best practices. Due to the breadth of content, different portions of the whitepaper will appeal to managers, IT professionals, and self-service authors. This whitepaper is usually updated every 12-24 months.

The whitepaper goes deeper into the "what" and "how" of adopting Power BI with a stronger focus on technology. When you're done with this series of articles, the whitepaper will provide additional information to put your plan into action.

## Microsoft's BI transformation

We suggest reviewing the articles about [Microsoft's journey and experience with driving a data culture](center-of-excellence-microsoft-business-intelligence-transformation.md). The articles discuss the importance of discipline at the core and flexibility at the edge, and they also cover how Microsoft views the importance of a Center of Excellence (COE).

## Power Platform adoption

The Power Platform team has an excellent set of adoption-related content with a primary focus on Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents. Many of these ideas may also be applied to Power BI.

The [Power CAT Adoption Maturity Model](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/power-cat-adoption-maturity-model-repeatable-patterns-for-successful-power-platform-adoption/), published by the Power CAT team, includes repeatable patterns for successful Power Platform adoption.

The [Power Platform Center of Excellence Starter Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit) is a collection of components and tools to help you develop a strategy for adopting and supporting Microsoft Power Platform.

The [Power Platform adoption best practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/adoption/methodology) includes a helpful set of documentation and best practices to align business and technical strategies.

The [Power Platform adoption framework](https://github.com/PowerPlatformAF/PowerPlatformAF/wiki) is community-driven project with excellent resources on adoption of Power Platform services at scale.

## Microsoft 365 and Azure adoption

You may also find useful adoption-related guidance published by other technology teams at Microsoft.

The [Maturity Model for Microsoft 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/community/microsoft365-maturity-model--intro) includes information and resources to use capabilities more fully and efficiently. Microsoft Learn includes a series of modules to [use the Microsoft service adoption framework to drive adoption in your enterprise](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/m365-service-adoption/).

The [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/) is a collection of documentation, implementation guidance, best practices, and tools to accelerate your cloud adoption journey.

A wide variety of other adoption guides for individual technologies can be found online. A few examples include:

- [Microsoft Teams adoption guide](https://teamworktools.azurewebsites.net/tft/#p=1)
- [Microsoft Security and Compliance adoption guide](https://teamworktools.azurewebsites.net/sec/)
- [SharePoint Adoption Resources](https://resources.techcommunity.microsoft.com/resources/sharepoint-adoption/)

## Industry guidance

The [Data Management Maturity (DMM) model](https://cmmiinstitute.com/data-management-maturity) is a paid resource from ISACA. It is a comprehensive framework of data management practices in six key categories that helps organizations benchmark their capabilities, identify strengths and gaps, and leverage their data assets to improve business performance.

The [Data Management Book of Knowledge](https://www.dama.org/cpages/body-of-knowledge) (DMBOK2) is a book available for purchase from DAMA International. It contains a wealth of information about maturing your data management practices.

These resources are not required to take advantage of the guidance provided in this Power BI adoption series. They are reputable resources should you wish you continue your journey.
