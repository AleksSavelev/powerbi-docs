# Power BI adoption roadmap maturity levels

There are three inter-related perspectives for which to consider adoption of a technology such as Power BI.

:::image type="content" source="media/powerbi-adoption-roadmap-maturity-levels/powerbi-adoption-roadmap-adoption-types.png" alt-text="Image shows the three inter-related types of Power B I adoption, which are described in the table below.":::

The three types of adoption shown in the above graphic include:

| **Item** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ![Item 1.](media/common/icon-01-red-30x30.png) | **Organizational adoption:** Organizational adoption refers to the effectiveness of Power BI governance and data management practices to support and enable business intelligence efforts. |
| ![Item 2.](media/common/icon-02-red-30x30.png) | **User adoption:** User adoption is the extent to which consumers and creators continually increase their knowledge and are actively using Power BI in the most effective way. |
| ![Item 3.](media/common/icon-03-red-30x30.png) | **Solution adoption:** Solution adoption refers to the impact and business value achieved for individual requirements and artifacts. |

As the four arrows in the previous diagram indicate, the three types of adoption are all strongly inter-related:

- **Solution adoption affects user adoption.** A well-designed and well-managed solution (which could be many things such as a set of reports, an app, or a dataset) impacts and educates users on how to use Power BI in an optimal way.
- **User adoption impacts organizational adoption.** The patterns and practices used by individual users influences organizational adoption decisions, policies, and practices.
- **Organizational adoption influences user adoption.** Effective organizational practices, including mentoring, training, support, and community encourage users to do the right thing in their normal workflow.
- **User adoption affects solution adoption.** Stronger user adoption, via the effective use of Power BI by educated and informed users, equates to stronger, more successful, individual solutions.

The remainder of this article introduces the three types of Power BI adoption in more detail.

## Organizational adoption maturity levels

Organizational adoption measures the state of Power BI governance and data management practices. The goals for organizational adoption are to effectively support the community, enable and empower users, and oversee information delivery via enterprise BI and self-service BI with continuous improvement cycles.

We can best think about organizational adoption from the perspective of a maturity model. For consistency with the [Power CAT adoption maturity model](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/power-cat-adoption-maturity-model-repeatable-patterns-for-successful-power-platform-adoption/) and the [maturity model for Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/community/microsoft365-maturity-model--intro), we are using the five levels from the [Capability Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model) which were later enhanced by the [Data Management Maturity (DMM) model from ISACA](https://cmmiinstitute.com/data-management-maturity) (note the DMM is a paid resource).

Every organization has limited time, funding, and people which requires them to be selective about where they prioritize their efforts. To get the most from your investment with Power BI, seek to attain level at least maturity level 300 or 400 discussed below. It's unavoidable that individual business units in the organization will evolve and mature at different rates, so you'll want to be cognizant of the organizational state as well as progress for key business units.

> [!NOTE]
> Organizational adoption maturity is a long journey. It takes time, effort, and planning to progress to the higher levels.

### Maturity level 100 – Initial

Level 100 is referred to as "initial" or "performed." It is the starting place for new data-related investments which are new, undocumented, and without any process discipline.

Common characteristics of level 100 include:

- Pockets of success and experimentation with Power BI exist in one or more areas of the organization.
- Achieving quick wins has been a priority and has produced some successes.
- Organic growth has led to the lack of a coordinated strategy or governance approach.
- Practices are undocumented, with significant reliance on tribal knowledge.
- There are few formal processes in place for effective data management.
- Risk exists due to a lack of awareness of how data is being used throughout the organization.
- The potential for a strategic investment with Power BI is acknowledged, but there is no clear path forward for purposeful, organization-wide execution.

### Maturity level 200 – Repeatable

Level 200 is referred to as "repeatable" or "managed." At this point of the maturity curve, data management is planned and executed based on defined processes though they may not be consistently followed uniformly throughout the entire organization.

Common characteristics of level 200 include:

- Certain Power BI content has become critical in importance and/or is broadly used in the organization.
- Attempts have been made at documentation, discipline, and repeatable practices, though efforts may be siloed, reactive, and have varying levels of success.
- There is an over-reliance on individuals having good judgment and good habits that they learned on their own.
- Usage of Power BI continues to grow organically and produce value, albeit in an ad hoc, uncontrolled manner.
- Resources for an internal community have been established (such as a Teams channel or Yammer group).
- Initial planning for a consistent Power BI governance strategy have been taken.
- There is recognition of the positive influence that a Power BI Center of Excellence can have.

### Maturity level 300 – Defined

Level 300 is referred to as "defined." At this point a set of standardized data management processes are established and consistently followed across organizational boundaries.

Common characteristics of level 300 include:

- Measurable success is being achieved for the effective use of Power BI.
- Progress has been made on the standardization of repeatable practices, though less-than-optimal aspects may still exist due to early organic growth.
- The Power BI Center of Excellence is established, with clear goals and scope of responsibilities.
- The internal community has gained traction and involvement from more users.
- Power BI champions are beginning to emerge in the community.
- Initial investments in training, documentation, and resources have been made.
- An initial governance model is in place.
- Power BI has an active and engaged executive sponsor.
- Roles and responsibilities for all Power BI stakeholders are well understood.

### Maturity level 400 – Capable

Level 400 is known as "capable" or "measured." At this point of the maturity curve, data is well-managed across its entire lifecycle.

Common characteristics of level 400 include:

- Business intelligence efforts are bringing significant value.
- Power BI is being used for critical content throughout the organization.
- There is an established and accepted governance model with cooperation from all major business units.
- Training, documentation, and resources are readily available for and actively used by the Power BI community of users.
- Standardized processes are in place for the oversight and monitoring of Power BI usage and practices.
- The Power BI Center of Excellence includes representation from all major business units.
- A Power BI champions network is established to support the internal community; champions actively work with immediate colleagues and the Center of Excellence.

### Maturity level 500 – Efficient

Level 500 is known as "efficient" or "optimizing" because the emphasis is now on automation and continuous improvement.

Common characteristics of level 500 include:

- The value of Power BI solutions is prevalent in the organization, and Power BI is widely accepted throughout the organization.
- Power BI skillsets are highly valued in the organization and recognized by leadership.
- The internal Power BI community is self-sustaining, with support from the Center of Excellence. The community is not over-reliant on any key individuals.
- Key performance indicators are reviewed regularly to measure success for implementation and adoption goals.
- Continuous improvement is an ongoing priority.
- Automation is used when it adds value, improves productivity, or reduces risk for error.

> [!TIP]
> The above characteristics are generalized. When considering maturity levels and crafting a plan, you'll want to consider each topic or goal independently. It's not attainable for every single aspect of Power BI adoption throughout the entire organization to reach level 500. Assessing maturity levels independently per goal allows you to prioritize your efforts where they will be most valuable. The remainder of the articles in this Power BI adoption series will present maturity levels on a per-topic basis.

Individuals - and the organization itself - are continually learning, changing, and improving which means there's no formal end to adoption-related efforts. However, the level on ongoing effort is reduced after achieving a higher maturity level.

The remainder of this article introduces the second and third types of adoption: user adoption and solution adoption. However, all other articles in this series are focused primarily on organizational adoption.

## User adoption stages

User adoption measures the extent to which content consumers and self-service content creators are actively using Power BI effectively. Usage statistics alone does not signify user adoption. User adoption is also concerned with individual user behaviors and practices to ensure Power BI is being used in the way in which it was intended, and to its fullest extent.

The concept of user adoption encompasses both consumers viewing content, as well as self-service creators who generate content for their colleagues to consume.

User adoption occurs on an individual user basis, while its measured and analyzed in the aggregate. Individual users progress through the four stages of user adoption at their own pace. An individual who is adopting a new technology will take some time to achieve proficiency. Some users will be eager; others will be reluctant to learn yet another tool regardless of the promised productivity improvements. Advancing through the user adoption stages involves time and effort and will involve behavior changes to become aligned with organizational adoption objectives. The extent to which the organization supports users advancing through the user adoption stages has a direct correlation to their organizational-level adoption maturity.

### User adoption stage 1 – Awareness

Common characteristics of stage 1 include:

- An individual has heard of or been initially exposed to Power BI in some way.
- An individual may have access to Power BI but is not actively using it.

### User adoption stage 2 – Understanding

Common characteristics of stage 2 include:

- An individual has an initial understanding of the benefits of Power BI for delivering analytical value and decision-making.
- An individual is showing interest in trying to use Power BI.

### User adoption stage 3 – Momentum

Common characteristics of stage 3 include:

- An individual is actively learning skills, through formal training, self-directed learning, and experimentation.
- An individual has gained basic competency with the aspects of Power BI most relevant to their job role.

### User adoption stage 4 – Proficiency

Common characteristics of stage 4 include:

- An individual is actively using Power BI on a regular basis.
- An individual understands how to use Power BI in the way in which it was intended, as relevant for their job role.
- An individual has modified their behavior and activities to align with organizational governance processes.
- An individual's willingness to support organizational processes and change efforts has grown over time, thus becoming an advocate for Power BI in the organization.
- An individual makes the effort to continually improve their skills and stay current with product changes and enhancements.

It's easy to underestimate the effort it takes to get from stage 2 (understanding) to stage 4 (proficiency). Typically, the biggest time gap is between stage 3 (momentum) and stage 4 (proficiency).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By the time a person reaches the momentum and proficiency stages, the organization needs to be prepared to support the individual in their efforts. There may also be some proactive efforts to assist users progressing through stages. See the [community of practice article](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-community-of-practice.md), and the [user support article](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-user-support.md) for additional discussion.

## Solution adoption phases

Solution adoption is concerned with measuring the impact of individual Power BI solutions, and the level of value solutions are providing. The scope for evaluating solution adoption is for one set of requirements, one set of reports, or perhaps one Power BI app.

As a solution progresses to phases 3 or 4, expectations for operationalizing the solution are higher.

> [!TIP]
> In the [content delivery scope article](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-content-delivery-scope.md), we discuss the importance of scope on expectations for governance. That concept is closely related to this but approaches it from a different angle. For instance, perhaps you have a new solution which has been operationalized and is distributed to many users. This doesn't immediately equate to phase 4 solution adoption, as the concept of solution adoption is focused on how much value the content brings.

### Solution phase 1 – Exploration

Common characteristics of phase 1 solutions include:

- Exploration is the main approach to proving out ideas. This could occur through informal self-service BI, or through a formal proof of concept (POC) which is purposely narrow in scope and used for confirming requirements, validating assumptions, addressing unknowns, and mitigating risks.
- A small group of users are using the proof of concept and providing useful feedback on it.
- All exploration, and initial feedback, could be occurring within Power BI Desktop or Excel. Use of the Power BI service is limited.

### Solution phase 2 – Functional

Common characteristics of phase 2 solutions include:

- The solution is functional and meets the basic set of user requirements, likely with plans to iterate on improvements and enhancements.
- The solution has been deployed to the Power BI service.
- All necessary supporting components are in place, such as scheduled refresh or use of a gateway.
- Users are aware of the solution and are showing interest in using it. Potentially this may be a limited release and may not yet be promoted to a production [workspace](../collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).

### Solution phase 3 – Valuable

Common characteristics of phase 3 solutions include:

- Target users consider the solution to be valuable and are experiencing tangible benefits.
- The solution has been promoted to a production [workspace](../collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).
- Validations and testing occur to ensure data quality, accurate presentation, accessibility, and performance.
- Content is certified ([endorsed](../collaborate-share/service-endorse-content.md)) when appropriate.
- Usage metrics for the solution are actively being monitored.
- Feedback loops are in place to facilitate suggestions and improvements to increase value.
- The solution is fully documented with information consumers need (such as data sources used or how metrics are calculated), and with information future creators need (such as any future maintenance or planned enhancements).
- Ownership and subject matter experts for the content is clear.
- Report branding and theming are in place per governance guidelines.

### Solution phase 4 – Essential

Common characteristics of phase 4 solutions include:

- The solution is actively used on a routine basis by the target users and is considered essential for decision-making purposes.
- The solution has a [production workspace](../create-reports/deployment-pipelines-overview.md) separate from development or test content. Change management and release management is carefully controlled due to the impact of changes.
- A subset of users regularly provide feedback to ensure the solution continues to meet needs.
- Expectations for the success of the solution are clear and are being measured.
- Expectations for support of the solution are clear, including if there are any service level agreements.
- The solution aligns with organizational governance guidelines and practices.
- Most content is [certified](../collaborate-share/service-endorse-content.md) since it's critical in nature.
- Formal user acceptance testing for new changes may occur, particularly for IT-managed content.
