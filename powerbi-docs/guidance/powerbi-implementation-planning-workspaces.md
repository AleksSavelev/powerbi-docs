# Power BI implementation planning: Workspaces

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-implementation-planning-context](includes/powerbi-implementation-planning-context.md)]

When a content creator has finished developing and testing content, the content may be published to the Power BI service for distribution and further collaboration with others. A workspace is a container for storing and securing artifacts that have been published to the Power BI service.

Proper workspace planning is an integral part of making a Power BI implementation successful.

The workspace planning content is organized as follows:

- [Tenant-level workspace planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md)
- [Workspace-level workspace planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-workspace-level-planning.md)
- [Workspace auditing](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-auditing.md)

The workspace planning content is targeted to multiple audiences:

- **Center of Excellence, IT, and BI team:** The tenant-level planning and workspace auditing topics are targeted primarily to Power BI administrators and others who are responsible for overseeing Power BI in your organization.
- **Content creators and owners:** The workspace-level planning topics are targeted primarily to people who need to create, publish, and manage content in workspaces. This includes workspace administrators, members, and contributors.

## Next steps

In the [next article](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md) in this series, learn about tenant-level workspace planning considerations.
