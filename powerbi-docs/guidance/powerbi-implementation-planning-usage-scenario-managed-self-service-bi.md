# Power BI usage scenarios: Managed self-service BI

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-implementation-planning-context](includes/powerbi-implementation-planning-context.md)]

As described in the [Power BI adoption roadmap](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-content-ownership-and-management.md#managed-self-service-bi), *managed self-service BI* is characterized by a blended approach that emphasizes *discipline at the core* and *flexibility at the edge*. The data architecture is maintained by a single team who are usually centralized BI experts, while reporting responsibility belongs to creators within departments or business units.

Usually, there are many more report creators than dataset creators. These report creators can exist in any area of the organization. Because self-service report creators often need to quickly produce content, a blended approach allows them to focus on producing reports that support timely decision-making without the additional effort of creating a dataset.

## Scenario diagram

The following diagram depicts a high-level overview of the most common user actions and Power BI components that support managed self-service BI. The primary objective is for many report creators to reuse centralized shared datasets. To accomplish that, this scenario focuses on decoupling the model development process from the report creation process.

The above diagram depicts the following user actions, tools, and features:

| **Item** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| ![Item 1.](media/common/icon-01-red-30x30.png) | Dataset creators develop models using Power BI Desktop. For datasets that are intended for reuse, it's common (but not required) for creators to belong to a centralized team that supports users across organizational boundaries (such as IT, enterprise BI, or the Center of Excellence). |
| ![Item 2.](media/common/icon-02-red-30x30.png) | Power BI Desktop connects to data from one or more data sources. |
| ![Item 3.](media/common/icon-03-red-30x30.png) | Data model development is done in Power BI Desktop. Additional effort is made to create a well-designed and user-friendly model because it will be used as a data source by many self-service report creators. |
| ![Item 4.](media/common/icon-04-red-30x30.png) | When ready, dataset creators publish their Power BI Desktop file (.pbix) that contains only a model to the Power BI service. |
| ![Item 5.](media/common/icon-05-red-30x30.png) | The dataset is published to a workspace dedicated to storing and securing shared datasets. Since the dataset is intended for reuse, it's [endorsed](../collaborate-share/service-endorse-content.md) (certified or promoted, as appropriate). The dataset is also marked as [discoverable](../collaborate-share/service-discovery.md) to further encourage its reuse. The [lineage view](/collaborate-share/service-data-lineage.md) in the Power BI service can be used to track dependencies that exist between artifacts. |
| ![Item 6.](media/common/icon-06-red-30x30.png) | [Dataset discovery in the datasets hub](../connect-data/service-datasets-hub.md) is enabled because the dataset is marked as discoverable. Discoverability allows the existence of a dataset to be visible in the datasets hub by other Power BI content creators who are looking for data. |
| ![Item 7.](media/common/icon-07-red-30x30.png) | Report creators use the datasets hub in the Power BI service to search for discoverable datasets. |
| ![Item 8.](media/common/icon-08-red-30x30.png) | If report creators don't have permission, they can request [Build](/connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md) permission on the dataset. This starts a workflow to request Build permission from an authorized approver. |
| ![Item 9.](media/common/icon-09-red-30x30.png) | Report creators create new reports using Power BI Desktop. Reports use a [live connection](../connect-data/desktop-report-lifecycle-datasets.md) to a shared dataset. |
| ![Item 10.](media/common/icon-10-red-30x30.png) | Report creators develop reports in Power BI Desktop. |
| ![Item 11.](media/common/icon-11-red-30x30.png) | When ready, report creators publish their Power BI Desktop file to the Power BI service. |
| ![Item 12.](media/common/icon-12-red-30x30.png) | Reports are published to a workspace dedicated to storing and securing reports and dashboards. |
| ![Item 13.](media/common/icon-13-red-30x30.png) | Published reports remain connected to the shared datasets that are stored in a different workspace. Any changes to the shared dataset affect all reports connected to it. |
| ![Item 14.](media/common/icon-14-red-30x30.png) | Other self-service report creators can author new reports using the existing shared dataset. Report creators can choose to use Power BI Desktop, Power BI Report Builder, or Excel. |
| ![Item 15.](media/common/icon-15-red-30x30.png) | To connect to data sources that reside within a private organizational network, an On-premises data gateway is required for data refresh. |
| ![Item 16.](media/common/icon-16-red-30x30.png) | Power BI administrators oversee and monitor activity in the Power BI service. |

## Key points

The following are some key points to emphasize about the managed self-service BI scenario.

### Shared dataset

The key aspect of making *managed self-service* BI work is to minimize the number of datasets. This scenario depicts a [shared dataset](../connect-data/service-datasets-across-workspaces.md) that contributes towards achieving a *single version of the truth*.

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity, this scenario depicts just one shared dataset. However, it's not usually practical to model all organizational data in a single dataset. The other extreme is to create a new dataset for every report, as less experienced content creators often do. The goal of managed self-service BI is to find the right balance, leaning toward relatively few datasets and creating new datasets when it makes sense to do so.

### Decouple dataset and reports

When the dataset is decoupled from reports, it facilitates the separation of effort and responsibility. A shared dataset is commonly maintained by a centralized team (like IT, BI, or COE), while reports are maintained by subject matter experts in the business units. However, that's not required. For example, this pattern can be followed by any content creator that wants to achieve reusability.

> [!NOTE]
> For simplicity, dataflows aren't depicted in this scenario. To learn about dataflows, see the [self-service data preparation](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-self-service-data-preparation.md) scenario.

### Dataset endorsement

Because shared datasets are intended for reuse, it's helpful to [endorse](../collaborate-share/service-endorse-content.md) them. A *certified* dataset conveys to report creators that the data is trustworthy and meets the organization's quality standards. A *promoted* dataset highlights that the dataset owner believes the data is valuable and worthwhile for others to use.

> [!TIP]
> It's a best practice to have a consistent, repeatable, rigorous process for use of the certified endorsement. Certified content should indicate that data quality has been validated. Certified content should also follow change management rules, have formal support, and be fully documented. Because certified content has passed rigorous standards, the expectations for trustworthiness are higher.

### Dataset discovery

The [datasets hub](../connect-data/service-datasets-hub.md) helps report creators find, explore, and use datasets across the organization. In addition to dataset endorsement, [enabling dataset discovery](../connect-data/service-datasets-hub.md#make-your-dataset-discoverable) is critical for promoting its reuse. A discoverable dataset is visible in the datasets hub for report creators who are searching for data.

> [!NOTE]
> If a dataset isn't configured to be discoverable, only Power BI users with Build permission can find it.

### Request dataset access

A report creator may find a dataset in the [datasets hub](../connect-data/service-datasets-hub.md) that they want to use. If they don't have Build permission for the dataset, they can request access. Depending on the [request access setting](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md#configure-how-users-request-build-permission) for the dataset, an email will be submitted to the dataset owner or custom instructions will be presented to the person who is requesting access.

### Live connection to the shared dataset

A Power BI Desktop [live connection](../connect-data/desktop-report-lifecycle-datasets.md) connects a report to an existing dataset. Live connections avoid the need to create a new data model in the report file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When using a live connection, all data that the report creator needs must reside within the connected dataset. However, the [customizable managed self-service BI](powerbi-implementation-planning-usage-scenario-customizable-managed-self-service-bi.md) scenario describes how a dataset can be extended with additional data and calculations.

### Publish to separate workspaces

There are several advantages to publishing reports to a workspace different from where the dataset is stored.

First, there's clarity on who's responsible for managing content in which workspace. Second, report creators have permissions to publish content to a reporting workspace (via workspace admin, member, or contributor roles). However, they only have Read and Build permissions for specific datasets. This technique allows [row-level security (RLS)](../admin/service-admin-rls.md) to take effect when necessary for users assigned to the viewer role.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you publish a Power BI Desktop report to a workspace, the RLS roles are applied to members who are assigned to the viewer role in the workspace. Even if viewers are given Build permission to the dataset, RLS still applies. For more information, see [Using RLS with workspaces in Power BI](../admin/service-admin-rls.md#using-rls-with-workspaces-in-power-bi).

### Dependency and impact analysis

When a shared dataset is used by many reports, those reports can exist in many workspaces. The [lineage view](../collaborate-share/service-data-lineage.md) helps identify and understand the downstream dependencies. When planning a dataset change, first perform [impact analysis](../collaborate-share/service-dataset-impact-analysis.md#perform-dataset-impact-analysis) to understand which dependent reports may require editing or testing.

### Gateway setup

Typically, a data gateway is required when accessing data sources that reside within the private organizational network or a virtual network. The [On-premises data gateway](../connect-data/service-gateway-onprem.md) becomes relevant once a Power BI Desktop file is published to the Power BI service. The two purposes of a gateway are to [refresh imported data](../connect-data/refresh-data.md), or view a report that queries a live connection or [DirectQuery](../connect-data/desktop-directquery-about.md) dataset.

> [!NOTE]
> For managed self-service BI scenarios, a centralized [data gateway](../connect-data/service-gateway-personal-mode.md#on-premises-data-gateway-vs-on-premises-data-gateway-personal-mode) in *standard mode* is strongly recommended over gateways in [personal mode](../connect-data/service-gateway-personal-mode.md). In standard mode, the data gateway supports live connection and DirectQuery operations (in addition to scheduled data refresh operations).

### System oversight

The [activity log](../admin/service-admin-auditing.md) records user activities that occur in the Power BI service. Power BI administrators can use the activity log data that's collected to perform [auditing](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-system-oversight.md#auditing) to help them understand usage patterns and adoption. The activity log is also valuable for supporting governance efforts, security audits, and compliance requirements. With a managed self-service BI scenario, it's particularly helpful to track usage of the shared dataset. A high report-to-dataset ratio indicates good reuse of datasets.
