# Power BI implementation planning: Workspaces

[!INCLUDE [powerbi-implementation-planning-context](includes/powerbi-implementation-planning-context.md)]

This workspaces article introduces the Power BI workspace planning articles. These articles are targeted at multiple audiences:

- **Power BI administrators:** The administrators who are responsible for overseeing Power BI in the organization.
- **Center of Excellence, IT, and BI team:** The teams that are also responsible for overseeing Power BI and supporting self-service users throughout the organization.
- **Content creators and owners:** Self-service BI creators who need to create, publish, and manage content in workspaces.

Proper workspace planning is an integral part of making a Power BI implementation successful. Inadequate workspace planning can lead to less user flexibility and inferior workarounds for organizing and securing Power BI content.

Fundamentally, a [Power BI workspace](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-new-workspaces) is a container in the Power BI service for storing and securing Power BI content. However, workspaces have many other capabilities and functionality that includes content distribution and collaboration.

The workspace planning content is organized into the following articles:

- **[Tenant-level workspace planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md):** Strategic decisions and actions that affect all workspaces in the tenant.
- **[Workspace-level planning](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-workspace-level-planning.md):** Tactical decisions and actions to take for each workspace.

## Next steps

In the [next article](powerbi-implementation-planning-workspaces-tenant-level-planning.md) in this series, learn about tenant-level workspace planning.
