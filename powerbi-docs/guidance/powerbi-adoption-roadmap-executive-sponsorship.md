# Power BI adoption roadmap: Executive sponsorship

When planning to advance the data culture and the state of organizational adoption for Power BI, it's crucial to have executive support. An executive sponsor is imperative because adopting Power BI is far more than just a technology project.

Although some successes can be achieved by a few determined individual contributors, the organization is in a significantly better position when a senior leader is engaged, supportive, informed, and available to assist with activities such as:

- Formulating a strategic vision and priorities for BI and analytics.
- Leading by example by actively using Power BI in a way that's consistent with data culture and adoption goals.
- Allocating and prioritizing staff and resource.
- Approving funding (for example, Power BI licenses).
- Communicating announcements that are of critical importance.
- Decision-making, particularly for strategic-level governance decisions.
- Dispute resolution (for escalated issues that cannot be resolved by operational or tactical personnel).
- Supporting organizational changes (for example, creating or expanding the [Center of Excellence](powerbi-adoption-roadmap-center-of-excellence.md)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ideal executive sponsor has sufficient credibility, influence, and authority throughout the organization.

## Identifying an executive sponsor

There are multiple ways to identify an executive sponsor.

### Top-down pattern

An executive sponsor may be selected by a more senior executive. For example, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) may hire a Chief Data Officer (CDO) or Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) to advance the organization's data culture objectives. The CDO then becomes the ideal candidate to become the executive sponsor for Power BI (or analytics in general).

Another example: The CEO may empower an existing executive, such as the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), because they have a good track record leading data and analytics in their organization. As the new executive sponsor, the CFO could then lead efforts to replicate the finance team's success to other areas of the organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Having a Power BI executive sponsor at the C-level is an excellent indicator. It indicates that the organization recognizes the importance of data as a strategic asset and is advancing its data culture in a positive direction.

### Bottom-up pattern

Alternatively, a candidate for the executive sponsor role could emerge due to the success they've delivered. For example, a business unit within the organization, such as Finance, has organically achieved great success with respect to their use of data and analytics. Essentially, they successfully formed their own data culture on a small scale. A leader who hasn't reached the executive level (such as a finance director) may then grow into the executive sponsor role by sharing successes with other business units across the organization.

The bottom-up approach is more likely to occur in smaller organizations. It's because the return on investment and strategic imperative of a data culture or digital transformation is not an urgent priority for C-level executives.

With a bottom-up approach, the sponsor may be able to make some progress, but they won't have formal authority over other business units. Without clear authority, it's only a matter of time until challenges occur that are beyond their level of authority. For this reason, the top-down approach has a higher probability of success. However, initial successes with a bottom-up approach can convince leadership to increase their level of sponsorship, which may start a healthy competition across other business units in the adoption of BI.

## Considerations and key actions

Here is a list of considerations and key actions you can take to establish or strengthen executive support for Power BI:

- Ensure you have clarity on who your executive sponsor is.
- Identify someone in a sufficient position of influence and authority (across organizational boundaries) who understands the value and impact of business intelligence. It is important that the individual has a vested interest in the success of analytics in the organization.
- Involve your executive sponsor in all strategic-level governance decisions involving business intelligence and data management.
- Involve your executive sponsor in all data culture initiatives to ensure alignment and consensus on goals and priorities.
- Formalize the arrangement with documented responsibilities for the executive sponsor role, so there is no uncertainty about expectations.
- Consider naming a backup executive sponsor. The backup can attend meetings in the sponsor's absence and make time-sensitive decisions when necessary.
- Identify influential advocates within the leadership team for each business unit. In addition to your executive sponsor, it is easier to accomplish your objectives if you have the cooperation and involvement of business unit leaders.

## Maturity levels

The following maturity levels will help you assess your current state of executive support:

| **Level** | **State of Power BI executive support** |
| --- | --- |
| 100: Initial | There is awareness from at least one executive about the strategic importance of how Power BI can play a part in advancing the organization's data culture goals. However, neither a Power BI sponsor nor an executive-level decision-maker is identified. |
| 200: Repeatable | Executive support exists for Power BI through informal channels and relationships. |
| 300: Defined | A formal arrangement exists for C-level Power BI sponsorship and support, with well-understood expectations for the role. |
| 400: Capable | Senior-level support is in place to grow and sustain the investment in Power BI by someone with sufficient authority across organizational boundaries. |
| 500: Efficient | Executive support is a driver for advancing the data culture vision. The executive sponsor is involved with ongoing organizational adoption improvements, and measurable goals are in place. |
