# Connect to the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 (Preview)

Calculate emissions from your tenant's usage of Microsoft 365 with the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365, now in preview.

Accurate carbon accounting requires good information from partners, vendors, and suppliers. The Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 gives you transparency on the carbon emissions generated by your organization's usage of Microsoft 365. Microsoft's carbon accounting extends across all three scopes of emissions with a 3rd party-validated methodology.

>[!NOTE]
> This dashboard is currently in preview and only includes emissions associated with your organization's usage of Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams.

## FAQs 

### App setup 

**I'm receiving an error at the time of connecting my data with the dashboard. What can I do?**

First, check in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center that you have one of the roles listed in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above. If you don't, request this access from your administrator. Next, ensure you're using the correct Microsoft 365 tenant ID. 

**I entered my tenant ID, but my company data isn't loading. What's the issue?** 

The Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 may take 24-48 hours to load your data after completing the connection process. Return after 24 hours and select the **Refresh** button in Power BI in the app workspace, as shown in the [Issues](#issues) section above.

### Emissions data

**I successfully connected to my tenant's data. Why do I see blank data in the report?**

This likely indicates that your tenant's emissions volumes are very small. The charts in this report do not display emissions values that are lower than 0.001 MTCO2e.

**Why can't I see emissions data for the previous month?**

Emissions data for a given month is available by the 14th day after the end of that month (including non-business days). Ensure that your dataset is scheduled to refresh automatically on a daily or weekly basis so that you always have access to the latest information.

**This report currently only includes Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft Teams. When will the remaining Microsoft 365 applications be added?**

Additional Microsoft 365 applications will be added over time. Check the Microsoft 365 Roadmap for the latest information on our feature release schedule.

**My emissions data for previous months appears to have changed since I last looked at it. What happened?**

We continuously make investments in improving the accuracy and completeness of this report. We may periodically restate historical data to account for these improvements, which may result in your historical emissions increasing or decreasing.

**Why do I see emissions from regions outside of my Microsoft 365 data location?**

Microsoft 365 emissions are allocated based on data storage as well as active usage and compute associated with Microsoft 365 applications. Emissions driven by compute may occur in regions outside your Microsoft 365 data location. Learn more about Microsoft 365 data residency [here](/microsoft-365/enterprise/o365-data-locations?view=o365-worldwidev&preserve-view=true).

**Where is the data used to produce this report stored?**

It is stored in the United States.

### Methodology 

**What is the methodology behind the tool?** 

The Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 reflects the specific cloud services consumed and the associated energy requirements, efficiency of the datacenters providing those services, electricity fuel mixes in the regions in which those datacenters operate, and Microsoft's purchases of renewable energy. As part of the app's development, the methodology and its implementation went through third-party verification to ensure that it aligns to the World Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The scope of the verification, conducted in accordance with ISO 14064-3: Greenhouse gases--Part 3: Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions, included the estimation of emissions from Microsoft 365 services, but excluded the estimation of on-premises emissions given the counterfactual nature of that estimate. A more detailed description of the carbon calculation is documented in the **Calculation Methodology** tab in the tool.

### Characterizing on-premises emissions 

**Where does the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 obtain data about my on-premises emissions and operations?**

The Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 doesn't obtain any information specifically about your on-premises datacenters except what you provide. As described in subsequent FAQs, the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 relies on industry research and user inputs about the efficiency and energy mix of on-premises alternatives to develop an estimate of on-premises emissions. 

**What are the assumptions regarding on-premises estimations? Are efficiency savings just from improvements in Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)?**

Efficiencies associated with Microsoft cloud services include far more than improved PUE. While Microsoft datacenters strive to optimize PUE, the primary efficiency improvements come from IT operational efficiency (dynamic provisioning, multitenancy, server utilization) and IT equipment efficiency (tailoring hardware to services ensuring more energy goes towards useful output), in addition to datacenter infrastructure efficiency (PUE improvements). Our [2018 study](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/05/17/microsoft-cloud-delivers-when-it-comes-to-energy-efficiency-and-carbon-emission-reductions-study-finds/)Â quantifies these savings compared to a range of on-premises alternatives ranging from low-efficiency to high-efficiency datacenters. These findings are used to estimate the energy use required for a corresponding on-premises datacenter to provide the same services that each customer consumes on the Microsoft cloud. 

**What is the assumed energy mix for the on-premises infrastructure?**

By default, the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 estimates on-premises emissions based on the mix of renewables and non-renewables on the grid. It is assumed that the on-premises datacenter would be located on the same grid as Microsoft's datacenters. However, for customers who purchase renewable electricityÂ *in addition* toÂ what's on the grid (for example, through Power Purchase Agreements), users can select the percentage of renewable electricity, and the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365 will adjust on-premises emissions accordingly. 

**When should I choose Low, Medium, or High for the efficiency of the on-premises infrastructure?**

Users should select the efficiency most representative of the on-premises deployment they would like to compare against, based on the equipment and datacenter characteristics here:

* **Low**: Physical servers and direct attached storage in small localized datacenter (500-1,999 square feet).
* **Medium**: Mix of physical/virtualized servers and attached/dedicated storage in mid-tier internal datacenter (2,000-19,999 square feet).
* **High**: Virtualized servers and dedicated storage in high-end internal datacenter (>20,000 square feet).
