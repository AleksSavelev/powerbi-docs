# Dataset details

The dataset details page helps you explore, monitor, and leverage datasets. When you click on a dataset in the [data hub](./service-data-hub.md), a workspace, or other place in Power BI, the details page for that dataset opens.

[ ![Screenshot of dataset details page.](media/service-dataset-details-page/dataset-details-page-inline-and-expanded.png)](media/service-dataset-details-page/dataset-details-page-inline-and-expanded.png#lightbox)

The dataset details page
* Shows you metadata about the dataset, including description, endorsement, and sensitivity.
* Provides actions that you can perform on the dataset, such as share, refresh, create new, Analyze in Excel, and more.
* Lists the reports and scorecards that are built on top of the dataset.

The page header displays the dataset name, endorsement (if any), and dataset owner. To send an email to the dataset owner or the dataset certifier (if any), click the header and then click the name of the owner.
