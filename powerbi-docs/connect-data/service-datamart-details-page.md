# Datamart details

The datamart details page helps you explore, monitor, and leverage datamarts. When you click on a datamart in the [data hub](./service-data-hub.md), a workspace, or other place in Power BI, the details page for that datamart opens.

The datamart details page
* Shows you metadata about the datamart, including description, endorsement, and sensitivity, and connection string.
* Provides actions that you can perform on the datamart, such as share, refresh, create new, Analyze in Excel, and more.
* Lists the reports that are built on top of the datamart.

## Explore related reports

The **See what already exists section** shows you reports that are built on top of the datamart's auto-generated dataset. You can create a copy of a report by selecting the line the item is on and clicking the **Save a copy** icon that appears. This section also shows you usage metrics for the related items.

>[!NOTE]
> Reports build on top of other datasets created from the datamart **aren't** shown in this section. 

The columns in the list of related reports are:
* **Name**: Report name. If the name ends with (template), it means that this report has been specially constructed to be used as a template. For example, "Sales (template)".
* **Type**: Item type, for example, report or scorecard.
* **Endorsement**: Endorsement status.
* **Workspace**: The name of the workspace where the related item is located.
* **Unique viewers**: Shows the total number of unique users who viewed the item at least once in the last 30 days, excluding the current day's views.
* **Views**: Shows the total number of times an item was viewed in the last 30 days, excluding the current day's views.

## Visualize this data

To create a report based on the dataset, click the **Create report** button on this tile and choose the desired option.

* **From scratch**: Opens the report editing canvas to a new report built on the dataset. When you save your new report, it will be saved in the workspace that contains the dataset if you have write permissions on that workspace. If you don't have write permissions on the workspace, or if you are a free user and the dataset resides in a Premium-capacity workspace, the new report will be saved in *My workspace*.

## Share this data

You can share the datamart with other users in your organization. Clicking the **Share datamart** button opens the [Share datamart dialog](service-datasets-share.md). People you share the datamart with get Build permission on the datamart.
