# Connect to PDF files in Power BI Desktop
In Power BI Desktop, you can connect to a **PDF file** and use the included data from the file, just like any other data source in Power BI Desktop.

![Connect to data in PDF files](media/desktop-connect-pdf/connect-pdf-04.png)

The following sections describe how to connect to a **PDF file**, select data, and bring that data into **Power BI Desktop**.

We always recommend upgrading to the most recent release of **Power BI Desktop**, which you can get from a link in [get Power BI Desktop](../fundamentals/desktop-get-the-desktop.md). 

## Connect to a PDF file
To connect to a **PDF** file select **Get Data** from the **Home** ribbon in Power BI Desktop. Select **File** from the categories on the left, and you see **PDF**.

![Select PDF from Get Data](media/desktop-connect-pdf/connect-pdf-01.png)

You're prompted to provide the location of the PDF file you want to use. Once you provide the file location and the PDF file loads, a **Navigator** window appears and displays the data available from the file, from which you can select one or multiple elements to import and use in **Power BI Desktop**.

Selecting a checkbox next to discovered elements in the PDF file displays them in the right pane. When you're ready to import, select the **Load** button to bring the data into **Power BI Desktop**.

Beginning with the November 2018 release of **Power BI Desktop**, you can specify the **Start page** and **End Page** as optional parameters for your PDF connection. You can also specify these parameters in the M formula language, using the following format:

`Pdf.Tables(File.Contents("c:\sample.pdf"), [StartPage=10, EndPage=11])`

## Limitations and considerations

When working with the PDF connector on datasets in a Premium capacity, the PDF connector does not properly make the connection. To enable the PDF connector to work on a dataset in a Premium capacity, configure that dataset to use a gateway, and confirm the connection to that dataset goes through the gateway.  


## Next steps
There are all sorts of data you can connect to using Power BI Desktop. For more information on data sources, check out the following resources:
