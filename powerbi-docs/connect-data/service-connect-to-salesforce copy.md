## What does the Sales manager dashboard tell us?

The Sales Manager sample dashboard and underlying report focus on a typical sales challenge: providing a total sales analysis over a certain period. 
This sample has three main objectives:
•	Understand how much we can generate from the total open opportunities that a Sales company has.
•	Identify which are the area we need to focus on the total sales life cycle.
•	What are the loopholes where we need to put our focus on?

Now let us analyze the elements in the dashboard 
1.	The top two visual shows us the total number of open opportunities we have and the expected revenue we can generate from it.
