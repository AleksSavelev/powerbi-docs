# Salesforce Analytics for Sales Managers

The Salesforce Analytics for Sales Managers template app includes visuals and insights for analyzing your marketing effort.

The app's out-of-the-box dashboard provides key metrics, such as your sales pipeline, best accounts, and KPI's. You can drill down into the report for more details on each aspect. Fully interactive visuals help you explore your data further.
