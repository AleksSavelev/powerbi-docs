# Dataset description

To help members of your organization quickly identify datasets that might be useful for them, provide a concise, informative description of your dataset in the dataset's settings. Users see this description in the tooltip next to the dataset's name in the datasets hub and on the dataset's details page.

Providing a meaningful description helps foster dataset reuse. For instance, based on a dataset's description, users may decide to explore reports that are based on the dataset, or to create their own reports based on the dataset.

## Provide a dataset description

To provide a description for a dataset, select the dataset to view the dataset details, then choose the **Add a description link**.

In the settings page, find the **Dataset description** section, and enter your description in the text box. Select **Apply** to save your description.
