## FAQs 

### App setup 

**I'm receiving an error at the time of connecting my data with the dashboard. What can I do?**

First, check in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center that you have one of the roles listed in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) section above. If you don't, request this access from your administrator. Next, ensure you're using the correct Microsoft 365 tenant ID. 

**I entered my tenant ID, but my company data isn't loading. What's the issue?** 

The Emissions Impact Dashboard may take 24-48 hours to load your data. Return after 24 hours and select the **Refresh** button in Power BI. 

**How am I supposed to use this data, and where do I report it?** 

Your emissions can be reported as part of your company's Scope 3 indirect carbon emissions. Scope 3 emissions are often disclosed in sustainability reports, CDP climate change, and other reporting outlets. In addition to the emissions totals, the emissions savings provide a clear example of how your company's decision to use Microsoft 365 services is contributing to global emissions reductions. To contextualize, the app indicates the equivalent vehicle miles avoided corresponding to the reduction in GHG emissions, based on EPA's equivalency calculator factors as of January 2020.
