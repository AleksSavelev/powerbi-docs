# Data details

The data details pages help you explore, monitor, and apply the data in your organization. When you select a data item in the [data hub](./service-data-hub.md), a workspace, or other place in the Power BI service, the detail page for that data item opens.

Select a data item type to see the details documentation for that type.

* [Dataset](service-dataset-details-page.md)
* [Datamart](service-datamart-details-page.md)
