[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Power BI's mobile layout view is used to create views of report pages that are optimized for viewing on mobile devices. Mobile layout view is available in both Power BI Desktop and in the Power BI service. This article explains how to open the mobile layout view and describes the features it provides.

## How to open mobile layout view

You can open mobile layout view in both Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.

# [Power BI Desktop](#tab/powerbi-desktop)

Select the **View** ribbon and choose **Mobile layout**.

* **Mobile layout canvas**: Create your mobile optimized view on the mobile layout canvas.
* **Page visuals pane**: The page visuals pane lists all of the visuals that are included on the original report page. From the visuals listed in the page visuals pane you choose which visuals you want to include in your mobile-optimized view.
* **Visualizations pane**: The visualizations pane enables you to format visuals by changing their format settings. The visualizations pane is empty until you select a visual on the canvas.
* **Selection pane**: The selection pane enables you to change the layering order of visuals on the canvas.

The canvas features a fine-grained grid to help you layout your visuals. Canvas controls enable you to turn off the grid, enable/disable snap-to-grid, and lock visuals in place to prevent them from accidentally being moved around. The grid scales across phones of different sizes, so your report looks good on small- and large-screen phones.
