# Create a quick page summary with Copilot for the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

The quick page summary is a way of creating a verbal description of the page. It's meant to be read in Copilot. You can't pin that description to the page. In Edit mode, it's possible to create a visual that summarizes the page. See the article [Create a narrative summary visual with Copilot for Power BI](copilot-create-narrative.md) for details.

## Create a page summary in Reading view

Using Copilot, you can quickly create a summary of an existing Power BI report in Reading mode.

1. In the ribbon, select **Copilot**.

1. In the Copilot pane, select **Summarize this page**, then select the arrow.

1. Scroll through the summary that Copilot has generated. You can also ask follow-up questions that Copilot has suggested.

## Create a page summary in Edit mode

1. Open a report in Edit mode and select **Copilot**.
1. In the Copilot pane, type *Create a summary of this page*.

    Copilot generates a summary in the Copilot pane, with footnotes showing which visual it used to create each bullet point.

1. Hover over each footnote to see which visual accounts for each bullet point.

## Considerations and limitations

- You can't save the summary to the report. However, you can copy the summary, open the report in Edit mode, and paste the summary in the report. At that point, it would just be static text and not associated with Copilot. In Edit mode, it's possible to create a visual that summarizes the page. See the article [Create a narrative summary visual with Copilot for Power BI](copilot-create-narrative.md) for details.
