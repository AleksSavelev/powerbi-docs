# Create quick reports in the Power BI service 

There's a new way to create reports quickly in the Power BI service. Instead of downloading the Power BI Desktop app and importing the data, you can paste data straight into Power BI on the web, and Power BI automatically generates visuals for you.  

New to creating in Power BI? Try reading [Reports in Power BI](../consumer/end-user-reports.md) for some quick background information.

## Create a quick report
In the navigation pane in the Power BI service, you can select the **Create** button that opens a page where you can select your data source. It's also accessible from the **New report** button on Home.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/create-entry-point.png" alt-text="Create entry point icon in the Power B I service."::: 

Currently, we only support creating a report based on an existing dataset, or typing or pasting data directly in a table. Over time you'll see other sources, such as uploading an Excel file.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/create-source-options.png" alt-text="Add data to create a report, source options.":::

When you choose to type or paste data, you get a grid which you can start to type into. You can also paste data by using Ctrl + V or the context menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/create-enter-data-window.png" alt-text="Type or paste in the Enter Data window.":::

You can use the context menu add and remove columns. If your pasted data includes a header row, select **Use first row as headers** to automatically promote the first row to the header row. Power BI automatically detects the data types, but you have the option to set them manually. Select the **Data type** button next to the column name. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/change-data-type.png" alt-text="Change the data type of the column."::: 

As you go through the creation process, Power BI creates a new dataset for you, and autogenerates a summarized view of your data. These autogenerated visuals propel you from raw data to insights faster than ever.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/autogenerated-report.png" alt-text="Power BI creates visuals based on your data automatically.":::

Changing the data you see in the report is easy, too. Use the **Summarize** pane to add or remove fields from the report. Select and unselect fields to update what you want to measure and analyze. Power BI automatically adds or removes charts to show the new combinations.  

Currently you can see a maximum of three measures, shown as rows within the report, and four categories, shown as columns within the report. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/summarize-pane.png" alt-text="Change the way Power B I summarizes the data in the Summarize pane.":::

To see a field summarized in a different way, use the context menu of the field in the **Summarize** pane to switch between sum, average, maximum, minimum, and so on. 

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/summarize-options.png" alt-text="Switch between sum, average, maximum, minimum, and so on.":::

You can save this report to the workspace you were in when you first selected **Create**. From there, you can share it, just like any other report. The next time you or anyone with edit permissions opens the report, you land right back in this quick edit experience.  

If you want to switch to a full edit experience, select the **Edit** button in the menu bar. Be aware though, that once you save the report in the full edit experience, you can't go back to the quick edit view.  

:::image type="content" source="media/service-quick-create-report/edit-entry-point.png" alt-text="Select the Edit button in the menu bar.":::

This experience should make it easier to create reports on your data and unlock the power of report building to a whole new set of users. Try the new Create experience today.

## Considerations and limitations

### Licenses

You need the same license to create a quick report as you do to create any other report in Power BI. If you have a free Power BI license and your My Workspace is assigned to a Premium capacity, you can create quick reports there. If you have a Power BI Pro license, you can create quick reports anywhere in the Power BI service. See [Power BI service features by license type](../fundamentals/service-features-license-type.md) for details.


### Get data limitations 

- If you use the **Paste or manually enter data** option, there’s currently no way to update the data later. If you want to add, modify, or delete data later, you need to go through the **Create** workflow again and get a new report.  
- If you have a CSV or Excel file, you need to use the paste option to add your data. A file upload option is coming later. 
- When copying data into the **Enter data** window, the size of data you paste in can't exceed 512 KB. 
- The table name can’t be longer than 80 characters, and column names can’t be longer than 512 characters.  
- Table and column names can’t contain double quotes ("), periods (.), or leading or trailing white spaces.  

### Model limitations

When going through this create process, you’re creating a model behind the scenes on the web. These web-authored models are similar to the ones created in Power BI Desktop, but do have a few limitations.

| Feature | Status  | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ALM | Not currently supported | ALM doesn't work for web-authored datasets. |
| Bring your own key (BYOK) | Not currently supported | You can't use your own encryption key for web-authored datasets. |
| Template apps | Not currently supported | You can't create apps for workspaces with web-authored datasets. |  
| Admin public APIs | Partially supported | Most admin public APIs are supported. However, there is a known issue with the following operation, **Admin - Groups GetGroupsAsAdmin with datasets expanded**. For this operation, web-authored datasets are returned, but the ContentProviderType is incorrectly marked as "RealTime". |

### Report limitations  

If you use the **Edit** option to switch into full editing mode and save the report, you can no longer switch back to the auto-generated view with the summarize pane. Power BI reminds you of this when you select **Edit**.
