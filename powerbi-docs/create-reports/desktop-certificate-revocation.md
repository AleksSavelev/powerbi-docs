# Certificate revocation check, Power BI Desktop

Certificates ensure the security of your connections to online data sources. You can check to see if a certificate has been revoked before you connect. Power BI offers two ways to enable or disable a certificate check: 

- In Options in Power BI Desktop.
- By editing the registry.

## Revocation check options

Both methods offer three possible settings:

- **Comprehensive check**: Reject certificates that have been revoked, and certificates without revocation information.
- **Basic check**: Only reject certificates that have been revoked. Certificates without revocation information are allowed through. This is important for some organizations with corporate proxy services.
- **None**, or **Disabled**:  Power BI doesn't check revocation information. All valid certificates are allowed through.

## Power BI Desktop

You can enable or disable the check in the user interface in Power BI Desktop. On the **File** menu > **Options and settings** > **Options**, select **Security**, then select one of the three options:

- **Comprehensive check**
- **Basic check**
- **None**

**Basic check** is the default selection.

## Registry settings

You can also control the certificate revocation check by setting the DWORD registry value `DisableCertificateRevocationCheck`. Admins can also use this method to control the setting for their whole organization.

- **Basic**
- **Disabled** is the same as **None** in Power BI Desktop.
- **Comprehensive**


|Certificate revocation information status | Comprehensive check | Basic check | Disabled |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Revoked     |  ❌  | ❌  | ✔   |
|Unknown  |  ❌    |  ✔   |    ✔  |
|Not revoked  | ✔  |    ✔ |    ✔  |

Set the DWORD registry value `DisableCertificateRevocationCheck` in the Power BI Desktop registry key. The key is in one of these formats, depending on your operating system:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Microsoft Power BI Desktop
```

Or:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Power BI Desktop
```

Set the registry value to one of the following values: 

|Value  |Mode  |Configuration  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|0     | Basic   | Certificates with an unknown revocation status are accepted. Equivalent to Basic in Power BI Desktop. |
|1     | Disabled  | Ignores all revocation checks. Equivalent to None in Power BI Desktop.  |
|2     | Comprehensive  |  Requires not revoking certificates. Doesn't accept certificates with unknown revocation status. Equivalent to Comprehensive in Power BI Desktop. |
