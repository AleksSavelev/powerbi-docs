# Arrange columns and metrics in Power BI scorecards

In some scenarios, you may want to reorder the metrics in a scorecard, or make one metric a submetric of another. You may also want to hide a column, or put the columns in a different order. As a scorecard author, you can make these changes, moving metrics and deciding the columns that your scorecard consumers see, and the order they're in, to optimize the scorecard for your audience.

## Reorder the metrics in a scorecard

It's easy to reorder metrics on the scorecard, or make them submetrics.

- Select a metric and drag it up or down. Indent it slightly to make it a submetric of another metric.

  When you make it a submetric, it takes the color of the metric it's under.

1. Open the scorecard in edit mode, and select the arrow icon next to the column you want to hide or move > **Column settings**.
