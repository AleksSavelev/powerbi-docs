# Show, hide, and move columns in Power BI scorecards (preview)

Some organizations may use all the columns in a scorecard, but in some scenarios, you may not want all the columns. As a scorecard author, you decide the columns that your scorecard consumers see, and each scorecard shows only columns that are appropriate to your scenario. You can also re-order the columns to best optimize the scorecard for your audience.

## Prerequisites

Creating goals is a Power BI Premium feature, so you need either:

- A Power BI Pro license and access to a [Power BI Premium](../admin/service-premium-what-is.md) capacity
- A [Power BI Premium Per User](../admin/service-premium-per-user-faq.yml) license.

You also need:

- Admin, Member, or Contributor role in a workspace. Read more about [roles in the new workspaces](../collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces.md).
- [Build permission](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md) for a dataset.

## Show, hide, or move a goal

1. In edit mode,select the arrow icon next to a column and open column settings.
1. Select which columns you want to show or hide.
1. Drag column names up or down to reorder them on the scorecard.
