1. Set a scheduled time for the subscription: 

    - On the hour, or at 15, 30, or 45 minutes past.
    - AM or PM.
    - The time zone.

You can add up to 24 subscriptions per scorecard, with unique recipients, times, and frequencies for each subscription. You can see all the subscriptions by opening the Subscriptions pane from a scorecard in My workspace, and selecting Manage all subscriptions; or from under the Settings > Subscriptions tab in the upper right corner of the Power BI service. 

Note that you can subscribe to scorecards if you have a Pro license or PPU license or if scorecard is in a workspace backed by Premium capacity. You can subscribe other team members if in addition to above, you are a Contributor, Member, or Admin role in that workspace. If the scorecard isn't hosted in a Premium capacity, others must also have a Pro license. You can add other email addresses in the same domain to the subscription. If the scorecard is hosted in a Premium capacity, you can subscribe group aliases, whether they're in your domain or not. You can subscribe external users if scorecard is hosted in a Premium capacity.
