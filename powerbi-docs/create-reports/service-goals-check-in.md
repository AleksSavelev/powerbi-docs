# Stay on top of your goals in Power BI (preview)

Goals in Power BI let customers curate their metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. In addition to seeing all your goals in one view, scorecards make it easy for you to dig deeper into the data and make notes on important events. These features are covered in this section. 

## View goal details 

The goals Details pane provides the entire history for the goal from the start date, including check-ins, status changes, and relevant notes. 

- To access the details pane, open a scorecard and select the goal name. Power BI automatically shows the details pane.
