# Stay on top of your goals in Power BI

Goals in Power BI let customers curate their metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. In addition to seeing all your goals in one view, scorecards make it easy for you to dig deeper into the data and make notes on important events. These features are covered in this section. 

Goal details 

The goals details pane provides the entire history for the goal from the start date, including check-ins, status changes, and relevant notes. To access the details pane, simply navigate to a scorecard, and select on the goal name. Power BI should automatically show the details pane as the following image.
