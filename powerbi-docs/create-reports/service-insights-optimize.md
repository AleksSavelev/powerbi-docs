# Optimize your data for Power BI Quick Insights

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Want to improve quick insights results?  If you are a dataset owner, try these suggestions:

* Hide or unhide columns in your dataset. Power BI quick insights doesn't search hidden columns.  So hide duplicate or unnecessary columns and unhide interesting columns.
* Use a mix of data types such as names, times, dates, and numbers.
* Avoid (or hide) columns with duplicate information.  Duplicate data takes valuable time away from searching for meaningful patterns.  For example, one column with state names spelled out and another column with state name abbreviations.
* Do you get an error message stating that your data isn't statistically significant?  Quick insights may generate that message in one of these instances:
    * Data models with models that are very simple.
    * Data models that don't have much data.
    * Data models that don't have date or numeric columns.
