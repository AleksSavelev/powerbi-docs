# Get started with goals in Power BI

Goals in Power BI let customers curate their metrics and track them against key business objectives, in a single pane. This feature enhances data culture by promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility for teams and initiatives within organizations.

If you are unfamiliar with any of the terms used in this manual, refer to the glossary section to learn more. 

## Prerequisites 

Goals is a Premium feature. Users can access various aspects of the experience depending on their license. 

|Permission  |Minimum requirements  |
|---------|---------|
|Authoring scorecards, goals, and performing check-ins | Power BI Premium capacity + Power BI Pro license <br><br>OR <br><br>Premium Per User license |
|Viewing scorecards and goals  | Power BI Premium capacity + Free user <br><br>OR <br><br>Premium Per User license |

If you donâ€™t meet the minimum requirements for any of these, contact your Power BI administrator before you begin.  

## Explore the Goals tab 

After you sign in to the Power BI service, select Goals from the navigation pane. Power BI displays your Goals hub page. The layout and content in the Goals page is different for every user. As a new user, your Goals page will be empty, as shown the following image.

### Goals relevant to me 

The top section contains all the goals that matter the most to you. Power BI curates these goals automatically, based on goals that you're assigned to, you've edited, or you've performed a recent check-in.

Goals must have at least two values to show up in this section. 

### Recent, Favorites, Shared with me, and All Scorecards 

The next section is a tabbed list. 

- **Recent** is the scorecards you've visited most recently. Each item has a timestamp. 
- **Favorites** are the scorecards you've starred (Star image). 
- **Shared with me** contains scorecards that your colleagues have shared with you. 
- **All scorecards** lists all the scorecards you have access to. 

### Sample scorecards 

The last section contains sample scorecards. As a new user, you can select one the pre-configured scorecards to check out what scorecards are all about. Selecting a sample opens the scorecard.
