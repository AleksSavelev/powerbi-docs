# Customize buttons in Power BI reports

Whether you create a button in Power BI Desktop or the Power BI service, you can customize it in many different ways to suit your requirements. For example, you can turn **Button Text** on or off, and change the button shape, icon, fill, title, or the action that's taken when users select the button in a report, among other properties.

## Change the shape

A rectangle is the default shape for buttons, but you can change the shape. You can also change the button shape.

- Select the button, navigate to the **Shape** tab of the **Format button** pane, customize the button to any of these shapes:

    - Arrow 
    - Chevron arrow
    - Pentagon arrow
    - Heart
    - Hexagon
    - Isosceles triangle
    - Octagon
    - Oval
    - Parallelogram
    - Pentagon
    - Pill
    - Rectangle
    - Right triangle
    - Rounded rectangle
    - Speech bubble
    - Snipped tab, top right
    - Snipped tab, both top
    - Rounded tab, top right 
    - Rounded tab, both top 
    - Trapezoid

 
## Add a custom image or icon

Another great way to customize your button is to add a custom image or icon for your button.

Here’s an example of a button with a custom image: 

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-customize-button/power-bi-custom-image.png" alt-text="An example of a button with a custom image.":::
  
Here's how.

1. Select the button, and navigate to the **Icon** tab of the **Format** button pane.
1. Select the **Custom** option for **Icon**, then select **Add image**.
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-customize-button/power-bi-add-custom-icon.png" alt-text="Select Add image to add a custom image.":::

1. After you add your image, you can customize the **Image fit** and **Icon placement**. With icon placement, you can place the image either **Left of text**, **Right of text**, **Below text**, or **Above text**.
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-customize-button/power-bi-icon-placement-illustration.png" alt-text="Illustration of image placement options.":::
 
    Or choose the **Custom** option to control the icon’s **Vertical** and **Horizontal alignment**:

1. You can also customize the **Icon size**. By default, icon size is set to **Auto**, meaning that as you resize the button, the icon size automatically changes size. Or you can set a fixed **Icon size** (in pixels) by typing a number in the **Icon size** box.

## Add effects

Just like Power BI built-in shapes, Power BI buttons can have artistic effects to suit your design needs:

- **Shape shadow** effects
- **Shape glow** effects
- Button **Shape rotation** and **Text rotation**
