# Download a sample template app from AppSource

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

The Marketing and Sales *template app* is available from Microsoft AppSource. A template app is a Power BI content type that combines related dashboards and reports. An app can have one or more dashboards and one or more reports, all bundled together. You can download the Marketing and Sales app from **Apps** in the Power BI service, or by going to AppSource in your browser.
