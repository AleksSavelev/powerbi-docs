# External tools in Power BI Desktop

Power BI has a vibrant community of BI professionals and developers. A vital part of that community are developers that create free tools that use Power BI and Analysis Services APIs to extend and integrate with Power BI Desktop's data modeling and reporting features. There are several different types of external tools:

**Semantic modeling** - Open-source tools such as DAX Studio, ALM Toolkit, Tabular Editor, and Metadata Translator extend Power BI Desktop functionality for specific data modeling scenarios such as DAX query and expression optimization, application lifecycle management (ALM), and metadata translation.

**Data analysis** - Tools for connecting to a model in read-only to query data and perform other analysis tasks. For example, tools that launch Python, Excel, and Power BI Report Builder and connect the client application to the model in Power BI Desktop for testing and analysis without having to first publish the Power BI Desktop (pbix) file to the Power BI service. Tools to document a Power BI dataset also fall into this category.

**Miscellaneous** - Some external tools donâ€™t connect to a model at all, but instead extend Power BI Desktop to make helpful tips and make helpful content more readily accessible. For example, PBI.tips tutorials, DAX Guide from sqlbi.com, and the PowerBI.tips Product Business Ops community tool, which makes installation of a large selection of external tools and their registration with Power BI Desktop, including DAX Studio, ALM Toolkit, Tabular Editor, and many others easy.

**Custom** - Integrate your own scripts and tools by adding a  *.pbitool.json document to the Power BI Desktop\External Tools folder.

Before installing external tools, keep the following in mind:

- External tools are not supported in Power BI Desktop for Power BI Report Server.

- External tools are provided by external, third-party contributors. Microsoft does not provide support or documentation for external tools.

## Featured open-source tools

There are many external tools out there. Here are some of the most popular and belong in every Power BI Desktop data modelers toolbox:

|Tool  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|PowerBI.tips - Business Ops      |   An easy to use deployment tool for adding external tools extensions to Power BI Desktop. The Business Ops goal is to provide a one stop shop for installing all the latest versions of external tools.

## External tools ribbon

The **External Tools** ribbon provides easy access to external tools that have been installed locally and registered with Power BI Desktop. When launched from the External Tools ribbon, Power BI Desktop passes the name and port number of its internal data model engine instance to the tool, as well as the current model name. The tool then automatically connects, providing a seamless connection experience.

### EnableExternalTools registry key

The External Tools ribbon is enabled by default, but can be disabled by using Group Policy or editing the registry directly.

- Registry key: Software\Policies\Microsoft\Power BI Desktop\
- Registry value: EnableExternalTools

A value of 1 (decimal) enables the External Tools ribbon, which is also the default value.

A value of 0 (decimal) disable the External Tools ribbon.

## External tools integration architecture

Power BI Desktop (pbix) files consist of multiple components including the report canvas, visuals, model metadata, and any data that has already been loaded from data sources. When Power BI Desktop opens a pbix file, it launches an Analysis Services process in the background to load the model so that the data modeling features and the report visuals can access model metadata and query model data.

When Power BI Desktop launches Analysis Services as its analytical data engine, it dynamically assigns a random port number and loads the model with a randomly generated name in the form of a globally unique identifier (GUID). Because these connection parameters change with every Power BI Desktop session, it's difficult for external tools to discover on their own the correct Analysis Services instance and model to connect to. External tools integration solves this problem by allowing Power BI Desktop to communicate the Analysis Services server name, port number, and model name to the tool as command-line parameters when starting the external tool from the External Tools ribbon, as shown in the following diagram.

:::image type="content" source="media/desktop-external-tools/external-tool-arch.png" alt-text="Esternal tool architecture":::

With the Analysis Services Server name, port number, and model name, the tool uses Analysis Services client libraries to establish a connection to the model, retrieve metadata, and execute DAX or MDX queries. Whenever an external data modeling tool updates the metadata, Power BI Desktop synchronizes the changes so that the Power BI Desktop user interface reflects the current state of the model accurately. However, there are some limits to the synchronization capabilities which are described later in [Data modeling operations](#data-modeling-operations).

## Data modeling operations

External data modeling tools can apply modifications and have Power BI synchronize those changes with the report canvas. This is so those modifications are consistently applied in Power BI visuals. For example, external data modeling tools can override the original format string expression of a measure, and edit any of the measure properties including KPIs and detail rows. External tools can also create new roles for object and row-level security, and add translations.

### Supported write operations

- Define and edit [measures](analysis-services/tabular-models/measures-ssas-tabular?view=power-bi-premium-current&preserve-view=true) for calculations, including format string, KPI, and detail rows settings.
- Add [calculation groups](analysis-services/tabular-models/calculation-groups?view=power-bi-premium-current&preserve-view=true) for calculation reusability in complex models. 
- Create [perspectives](analysis-services/tabular-models/perspectives-ssas-tabular?view=power-bi-premium-current&preserve-view=true) to define focused, business-domain specific views of dataset metadata.
- Apply [metadata translations](analysis-services/tabular-models/translations-in-tabular-models-analysis-services?view=power-bi-premium-current&preserve-view=true) to support multi-language versions within a single dataset.
- Add dataset roles for [row-level security (RLS)](../guidance/rls-guidance.md) and [object-level security (OLS)](analysis-services/tabular-models/object-level-security?view=power-bi-premium-current&preserve-view=true) rules to restrict data access.

### Data modeling limitations

All Tabular Object Model (TOM) metadata can be accessed for read-only. Write operations are limited because Power BI Desktop must remain in-sync with the external modifications, therefore the following operations are not supported:

- Any TOM object types not covered in Supported write operations, such as tables and columns.
- Editing a Power BI Desktop template (PBIT) file.
- Report-level or data-level translations.
- Renaming tables and columns is not yet supported

## Register an external tool

To register other external tools with Power BI Desktop, create a JSON file with the following content:

```json
{
    "name": "<tool name>",
    "description": "<tool description>",
    "path": "<tool executable path>",
    "arguments": "<optional command line arguments>",
    "iconData": "image/png;base64,<encoded png icon data>"
}
```

The pbitool.json file includes the following elements:
 
* **name:** Provide a name for the tool, which will appear as a button caption in the External Tools ribbon within Power BI Desktop.
* **description:** (optional) Provide a description, which will appear as a tooltip on the External Tools ribbon button within Power BI Desktop.
* **path:** Provide the fully qualified path to the tool executable.
* **arguments:** (optional) Provide a string of command-line arguments that the tool executable should be launched with. You may use any of the following placeholders:
    * **%server%:** Replaced with the server name and portnumber of the local instance of Analysis Services Tabular for imported/DirectQuery data models.
    * **%database%:** Replaced with the database name of the model hosted in the local instance of Analysis Services Tabular for imported/DirectQuery data models.
* **iconData:** Provide image data, which will be rendered as a button icon in the External Tools ribbon within Power BI Desktop. The string should be formatted according to the syntax for Data URIs without the "data:" prefix.

Name the file `"<tool name>.pbitool.json"` and place it in the following folder:

- `%commonprogramfiles%\Microsoft Shared\Power BI Desktop\External Tools`

For 64-bit environments, place the files in the following folder:

- **Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Power BI Desktop\External Tools**

Files in that specified location with the **.pbitool.json** extension are loaded by Power BI Desktop upon startup.

### Pbitool.json example

The following *.pbitool.json file launches powershell.exe from the External Tools ribbon and runs a script called pbiToolsDemo.ps1, passing the server name and port number in the -Server parameter and the dataset name in the -Database parameter.

```json
{ 
    "version": "1.0.0", 
    "name": "External Tools Demo", 
    "description": "Launches PowerShell and runs a script that outputs server and database parameters. (Requires elevated PowerShell permissions.)", 
    "path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe", 
    "arguments": "C:\\pbiToolsDemo.ps1 -Server \"%server%\" -Database \"%database%\"", 
    "iconData": "image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsEAAA7BAbiRa+0AAAANSURBVBhXY/jH9+8/AAciAwpql7QkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC" 
} 
```

The corresponding pbiToolsDemo.ps1 script outputs the Server and Database parameters to the console.

```powershell
[CmdletBinding()] 
param 
( 
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]         
[string] $Server, 
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]         
[string] $Database	 
) 
Write-Host "" 
Write-Host "Analysis Services instance: " -NoNewline 
Write-Host "$Server" -ForegroundColor Yellow 
Write-Host "Dataset name: " -NoNewline 
Write-Host "$Database" -ForegroundColor Green 
Write-Host "" 
Read-Host -Prompt 'Press [Enter] to close this window'  
```

:::image type="content" source="media/desktop-external-tools/json-example-output.png" alt-text="PowerShell console output ":::

### Icon data URIs

The iconData element takes a data URI without the **data:** prefix. For example, the data URI of a 1-pixel magenta png image is:

`data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsEAAA7BAbiRa+0AAAANSURBVBhXY/jH9+8/AAciAwpql7QkAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC`

Be sure to remove the **data:** prefix, as shown in the pbitool.json example above.

To convert a .png or other image file type to a data URI, use an online tool or a custom tool such as the one shown in the following C# code snippet:

```c#
string ImageDataUri; 
OpenFileDialog openFileDialog1 = new OpenFileDialog(); 
openFileDialog1.Filter = "PNG Files (.png)|*.png|All Files (*.*)|*.*"; 
openFileDialog1.FilterIndex = 1; 
openFileDialog1.Multiselect = false; 
openFileDialog1.CheckFileExists = true; 
bool? userClickedOK = openFileDialog1.ShowDialog(); 
if (userClickedOK == true) 
{ 
    var fileName = openFileDialog1.FileName; 
    var sb = new StringBuilder(); 
    sb.Append("image/") 
        .Append((System.IO.Path.GetExtension(fileName) ?? "png").Replace(".", "")) 
        .Append(";base64,") 
        .Append(Convert.ToBase64String(File.ReadAllBytes(fileName))); 
    ImageDataUri = sb.ToString(); 
} 
```
