# Write Copilot prompts that produce results in Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Here are some examples of prompts that work well with Copilot for Power BI. Use these prompts as examples. They may not generate the same outcome as these report pages. Each sample prompt is paired with a report page that Copilot generated based on the interpretation of that prompt. Your prompts help Copilot understand what you're looking for, but they may not produce a page that's exactly what you want. It's a starting point for report page creation. Use the user interface to modify the report page that Copilot created. Also, see the [Considerations and limitations section](#considerations-and-limitations) for features that currently don't work.

## Sales performance by product

"Create a page to analyze the sales amount, revenue, and profit margin of different products, categories, and subcategories over time and across regions."

## Customer segmentation and loyalty

"Create a page to identify and compare the characteristics, behaviors, and preferences of different customer segments based on demographic, geographic, and transactional data."

## Inventory and supply chain management

"Create a page to monitor and optimize the inventory levels, reorder points, safety stock, and product costs of different products and product lines based on demand, lead time, and manufacturing costs."

## Considerations and limitations 

We're continuously working to improve the quality of the report pages, including visuals and summaries generated by Copilot. Here are the current limitations.

- You can't tell it which kind of visual to create.
- Copilot can't modify the visuals after it has generated them.
- Copilot can't add filters or set slicers if you specify them in the prompts. For example, if you say: "Create a sales report for the last 30 days." Copilot can't interpret 30 days as a date filter.
- Copilot can't make layout changes. For example, if you tell Copilot to resize the visuals, or to align all the visuals perfectly, it won't work.
- Copilot can't understand complex intent. For example, suppose you frame a prompt like: "Generate a report to show incidents by team, incident type, owner of the incident, and do this for only 30 days." This prompt is complex, and Copilot will probably generate irrelevant visuals.
- Copilot doesn't produce a message for the skills that it doesn't support. For example, if you ask Copilot to edit or add a slicer, it won't complete the instruction successfully as mentioned above. Unfortunately, it will *not* give an error message either.
