# Overview of Copilot for Power BI (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-no-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-no-desktop-yes-service.md)]

This article is to help you get started creating reports with Copilot for Power BI and evaluating the results. Power BI has introduced generative AI that allows you to create reports automatically by selecting the topic for a report or by prompting Copilot on a particular topic. The following sections cover the details of the features and how to use Copilot.

For answers to common questions related to business data security and privacy to help your organization get started with Copilot for Fabric, see the article "Privacy, security, and responsible use for Copilot" in the Fabric documentation.

## Copilot requirements

### Power BI service

To use the summary skill in Copilot reports and create Copilot reports:

- Your tenant admin has enabled the Copilot setting at the tenant level. See the article "Copilot tenant settings (preview)" (fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-copilot)
- If the workspace is running on F64 or Premium capacity, then you can access Copilot for the Power BI service.
- You can have either read or write access to the workspace that's on F64 or Premium capacity.

### Power BI Desktop

You need write access to a workspace that is on F64 or Power BI Premium in the Power BI service, where you plan to publish the report.

## Before you start using Copilot

- Copilot sends your customer data to generate summaries to Azure OAI, where it's stored for 30 days. See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms) for details.
- We work continuously to improve the quality of the reports (including visuals) and summaries generated by Copilot. We aim to deliver a better experience for when the product reaches general availability.
- AI may generate content that has mistakes. Make sure it's accurate and appropriate before using it.

Read [Evaluate your data for use with Copilot for Power BI](copilot-evaluate-data.md) for more tips.

## Feature overview: Copilot capabilities

Copilot provides a summary of your dataset and an outline of suggested pages for your report. Then it generates those pages for the report.

After you open a blank report with a semantic model, Copilot can generate:  

- A [summary of your dataset](copilot-create-narrative.md).
- A [report outline of suggested pages for your report](copilot-create-report.md): for example, what each page in the report will be about, and how many pages it will create.  
- The visuals for the individual pages.
- A summary of the current page.

## Considerations and limitations 

We're continuously working to improve the quality of the report pages, including visuals and summaries generated by Copilot. Here are the current limitations.

- You can't tell it which kind of visual to create.
- Copilot can't modify the visuals after it has generated them.
- Copilot can't add filters or set slicers if you specify them in the prompts. For example, if you say: "Create a sales report for the last 30 days." Copilot can't interpret 30 days as a date filter.
- Copilot can't make layout changes. For example, if you tell Copilot to resize the visuals, or to align all the visuals perfectly, it won't work.
- Copilot can't understand complex intent. For example, suppose you frame a prompt like: "Generate a report to show incidents by team, incident type, owner of the incident, and do this for only 30 days." This prompt is complex, and Copilot will probably generate irrelevant visuals.
- Copilot doesn't produce a message for the skills that it doesn't support. For example, if you ask Copilot to edit or add a slicer, it won't complete the instruction successfully as mentioned above. Unfortunately, it will *not* give an error message either.
