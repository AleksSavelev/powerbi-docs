# Get samples for Power BI

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

Are you new to Power BI and you want to try it out, but you don't have any data? Or maybe you'd like to see reports that illustrate some of the capabilities of Power BI. We've got you covered.

Power BI offers different kinds of samples, for different purposes: 
- The **[Sales & Returns sample](#sales--returns-sample-pbix-file)** Power BI report (.pbix file). You can view it in the Data Stories Gallery, open and explore it in Power BI Desktop, or upload it to the Power BI service.
- The **[Artificial Intelligence sample](sample-artificial-intelligence.md)** Power BI report. In the report, you explore the Power BI artificial intelligence features such as key influencers, root-cause analysis in a decomposition tree, and anomaly detection. Download a copy from the **Learn** page in the Power BI service navigation pane.
- A **[sample template app](sample-sales-marketing-template-app.md)**. You download it from AppSource, also right in the Power BI service. Template apps include dashboards, reports, and datasets. You can modify them, then distribute them to your colleagues.
- **[Eight original built-in samples](#eight-original-samples)** in the Power BI service, with dashboards, reports, and datasets. You install them right in the Power BI service. The built-in samples are also available as Power BI reports (.pbix) and Excel workbooks (.xlsx).
- **[Excel workbook](#download-sample-excel-files)** versions of the built-in samples, containing the data model. You can explore the data model in the Power Pivot add-in for Excel or use the Excel workbook as a data source for a Power BI report.
- A **[Financial data sample workbook](sample-financial-download.md)**, a simple flat table in an Excel file available for download. It contains anonymized data with fictitious products, with sales divided by segments and countries/regions. It makes a useful basic data source for a Power BI report.
- An Excel workbook version of the **[AdventureWorks dimensional model](desktop-dimensional-model-report.md)**, in a tutorial to walk you through creating a Power BI report with the data. 

Our online documentation uses these same samples in tutorials and examples, so you can follow along.

## Sales & Returns sample .pbix file

*The Sales & Returns sample report*

Power BI report designers Miguel Myers and Chris Hamill created the Sales & Returns .pbix file to demonstrate many new features in Power BI, including buttons, drillthrough, conditional formatting, what-if, and customized tooltips. 

The scenario for this report is a company that sells Microsoft-themed skateboards. They want to see the state of their sales and returns, and analyze how they should modify their operations. 

You can explore it these ways:

- Download the .pbix file and explore it in depth. Look "behind the curtain" to see how Miguel made it. Selecting this link downloads the file automatically: [Sales & Returns sample report](https://github.com/microsoft/powerbi-desktop-samples/blob/main/Sample%20Reports/Sales%20%26%20Returns%20Sample%20v201912.pbix).
- Read about the report in the Power BI blog post, [Take a tour of the new Sales & Returns sample report](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/take_a_tour_of_the_new_sales_returns_sample_report/).

## Eight original samples
Eight original samples are available for you to use. Each sample represents a different industry. You can engage with each in different formats:

- Install the [built-in samples](#install-built-in-samples) in the Power BI service.
- Download the [Power BI report files](#download-original-sample-power-bi-files) (.pbix).
- Download the [Excel workbook files](#download-sample-excel-files) (.xlsx), then upload them to the Power BI service.
- Explore the [Excel files in Excel](#explore-excel-samples-in-excel) itself.

The company obviEnce ([www.obvience.com](http://www.obvience.com/)) and Microsoft teamed up to create samples for you to use with Power BI.  The data is anonymized and represents different industries: finance, HR, sales, and more. 

![Available samples](media/sample-datasets/power-bi-samples.png)

Each of these samples is available in several formats: as a built-in sample, as an Excel workbook, and as a Power BI .pbix file. If you don't know what these things are, or how to get your hands on them -- don't worry. This article explains it all. For each of these samples, we've created a *tour*. Tours are articles that tell the story behind the sample and walk you through different scenarios. One scenario might be answering questions for your manager, another might be looking for competitive insights, or creating reports and dashboards to share, or explaining a business shift.

Before we get started, here are the legal guidelines for using these samples. After that, we introduce the samples and show how to use them.

### Supplier Quality sample  ![Supplier Quality sample](media/sample-datasets/power-bi-sq.png)
[Take a tour of the Supplier Quality sample](sample-supplier-quality.md)

This industry sample focuses on one of the typical supply chain challenges — supplier quality analysis. Two primary metrics are at play in this analysis: total number of defects and the total downtime that these defects caused. This sample has two main objectives: understand who the best and worst suppliers are, with respect to quality, and identify which plants do a better job finding and rejecting defects, to minimize downtime.

### Install built-in samples

Let's start with the *built-in samples*. The built-in samples are available in the Power BI service; you don't have to leave Power BI to find them. These samples are each a bundle of one or more dashboards, datasets, and reports that someone creates and that can be used with the Power BI service. These built-in samples are still available, but are being deprecated. They aren't available for Power BI Desktop.

1. Open the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) and sign in.
2. Navigate to your My Workspace, or another workspace where you want to install the sample. 
2. In the bottom-left corner, select **Get data**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/power-bi-get-data.png" alt-text="Select Get data.":::

3. On the Get Data page that appears, select **Samples**.

   ![Samples on Get Data](media/sample-datasets/get-data-samples.png)
4. Select one of the samples to open a description of that sample, and choose **Connect**.  

   ![Select a sample > select Connect](media/sample-datasets/power-bi-connect.png)
5. Power BI imports the built-in sample and adds a new dashboard, report, and dataset to your current workspace. Use the samples to take Power BI for a test run.  

   ![New content in workspace](media/sample-datasets/power-bi-sample-workspace.png)

Now that you have data, you're on your way.  Try out some of our tutorials using the built-in samples or just open the Power BI service and explore.

### Download original sample Power BI files
Each of the built-in samples is also available as Power BI .pbix file. The .pbix files are designed to be used with Power BI Desktop.  

1. Download the files individually using the links below. Selecting these links saves the file automatically to your Downloads folder. 

   - [Customer Profitability Sample PBIX](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/A/9/6A93FD6E-CBA5-40BD-B42E-4DCAE8CDD059/Customer%20Profitability%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix)
   - [Human Resources Sample PBIX](https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/5/69503155-05A5-483E-829A-F7B5F3DD5D27/Human%20Resources%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix)
   - [Procurement Analysis Sample PBIX](https://download.microsoft.com/download/D/5/3/D5390069-F723-413B-8D27-5888500516EB/Procurement%20Analysis%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix)
   - [Retail Analysis Sample PBIX](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/6/D/96DDC2FF-2568-491D-AAFA-AFDD6F763AE3/Retail%20Analysis%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix)
   - [Sales and Marketing Sample PBIX](https://download.microsoft.com/download/9/7/6/9767913A-29DB-40CF-8944-9AC2BC940C53/Sales%20and%20Marketing%20Sample%20PBIX.pbix)
   - [Supplier Quality Analysis Sample PBIX](https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/C/6/8C661638-C102-4C04-992E-9EA56A5D319B/Supplier-Quality-Analysis-Sample-PBIX.pbix)

1. In Power BI Desktop, select **File > Open** and navigate to the location where you saved the sample .pbix file.

4. Select the .pbix file to open it in Power BI Desktop.


### Download sample Excel files
Each of the built-in samples is also available as an Excel workbook. The Excel workbooks are designed to be used with the Power BI service. If you're an advanced user, you might want to download the Excel workbooks to explore or edit the data models.

1. [Download a zip file of all the sample files](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=535020). 

   - Customer Profitability Sample
   - Human Resources Sample
   - Opportunity Tracking Sample
   - Procurement Analysis Sample
   - Retail Analysis Sample
   - Sales and Marketing Sample
   - Supplier Quality Analysis Sample

2. Save the downloaded file. Where you save the file makes a difference.

    ![Local](media/sample-datasets/power-bi-local-file2.png)  **Local** - If you save your file to a local drive on your computer or another location in your organization, from Power BI, you can import your file into Power BI. Your file remains on your local drive, so the whole file isn't imported into Power BI. What happens is a new dataset is created in your Power BI site and data, and in some cases the data model, are loaded into the dataset. If your file has any reports, those reports appear in your Power BI site under Reports.
    
    ![OneDrive Business](media/sample-datasets/power-bi-onedrive-file.png) **OneDrive - Business** – If you have OneDrive for Business and you sign into it with the same account you sign into Power BI with, OneDrive for Business is by far the best place to keep your work in Excel, Power BI, or a .CSV file in-sync with your dataset, reports, and dashboards in Power BI. Because both Power BI and OneDrive are in the cloud, Power BI connects to your file on OneDrive about every hour. If any changes are found, your dataset, reports, and dashboards are automatically updated in Power BI.
    
    ![SharePoint Team Sites](media/sample-datasets/save-sharepoint-logo.png) **SharePoint Team-Sites**    Saving your Power BI files to SharePoint – Team Sites is much the same as saving to OneDrive for Business. The biggest difference is how you connect to the file from Power BI. You can specify a URL or connect to the root folder.

### Explore Excel samples in Excel

(Optional) Want to understand how the data in these Excel workbooks gets converted to Power BI datasets and reports? Opening the Excel samples *in Excel* and exploring the worksheets provides some of the answers. 

- When you first open a sample workbook in Excel, you may see two warnings. The first warning says the workbook is in Protected View. Select **Enable Editing**. The second warning may say that the workbook has external data connections. Select **Enable Content**.
- Each workbook contains several Power View sheets. The Power View add-in is no longer supported in Excel, but when you upload the Excel file to the Power BI service, each Power View sheet is rendered as a Power BI report page.
- So where's the actual data? It's in the Power Pivot data model. You don't need the Power View sheets to see the data. On the **PowerPivot** tab, select **Manage**.

    Don't see the **Power Pivot** tab? [Enable the Power Pivot add-in](https://support.office.com/article/Start-Power-Pivot-in-Microsoft-Excel-2013-add-in-A891A66D-36E3-43FC-81E8-FC4798F39EA8).

    In Power Pivot, you can see the data in all the underlying tables, plus all the DAX formulas. 

- The Info tab provides information about obviEnce, the company that created the sample.

### Upload the Excel files to the Power BI service

1. Open the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com) and sign in.

1. Navigate to your My Workspace or to another workspace, or create a workspace just for the sample.

4. In the bottom-left corner of the navigation pane, select **Get data**.

   :::image type="content" source="../media/power-bi-get-data.png" alt-text="Select Get data.":::

5. On the **Get Data** page that appears, select **Files > Get**.

    ![Files > Get](media/sample-datasets/power-bi-files.png)
6. Select the location where you downloaded and saved the sample.

    ![Location where you saved the sample](media/sample-datasets/sample-files-select-location.png)
7. Select the file. Depending on where you saved the file, select **Connect** or **Open**.

8. Choose whether to import the data or to bring the workbook into Power BI and see it exactly as it is in Excel online.

    ![Import or Connect](media/sample-datasets/sample-files-import-connect.png)
9. If you select **Import**, Power BI imports the sample workbook and adds it as a new report and dataset, in this case each named **Procurement Analysis Sample**.

    Because the workbook has Power View sheets, Power BI creates a report with a page for each Power View sheet. 

10. Open the report. Select different elements of the report to explore their interactions.
