# Assign a workspace to a deployment pipeline

Deployment pipelines enables you to assign and unassign workspaces to any stage in a pipeline. This capability is particularly important for organizations that already have workspaces for each pipeline stage. In such cases, you can assign each workspace to its corresponding pipeline stage, and continue working in your usual flow.

After assigning a workspace to a deployment pipeline stage, if there are any adjacent stages already assigned, deployment pipelines attempts to create the connections between the Power BI items in the adjacent stages.

>[!NOTE]
>This article describes how to assign and unassign a workspace to a deployment pipeline stage in the Power BI service. You can also perform these functions programmatically, using the [Assign Workspace](/rest/api/power-bi/pipelines/assign-workspace) and [Unassign Workspace](/rest/api/power-bi/pipelines/unassign-workspace) Power BI REST APIs.

## Assign a workspace to a newly created pipeline

Follow these steps to assign a workspace in a deployment pipeline:

1. In the newly created deployment pipeline, select **Assign a workspace**.

2. In the *Choose the workspace* drop-down menu, select the workspace you want to assign to the pipeline.

    >[!NOTE]
    >Only workspaces that can be used with deployment pipelines, will show in the list of workspaces you can select from.

3. Select the stage you want to assign the workspace to.

## Assign a workspace to any vacant pipeline stage

To assign a workspace to a pipeline, the pipeline stage you want to assign the workspace to, has to be vacant. If you want to assign a workspace to a pipeline stage that already has another workspace assigned to it, [unassign](#unassign-a-workspace-from-a-pipeline-stage) the current workspace from that stage and then continue with assigning the new workspace.

Before you assign a workspace to a pipeline stage, review the [limitations](#limitations) section and make sure that the workspace meets the required conditions.

>[!NOTE]
>Before you assign or unassign a workspace to a pipeline, consider that every time you deploy to a vacant stage, a new workspace is created.

To assign a workspace to a pipeline stage, follow these steps:

1. Open the pipeline.

2. In the stage you want to assign a workspace to, expand the dropdown titled **Choose a workspace to assign to this pipeline**.

3. From the dropdown menu, select the workspace you want to assign to this stage.

4. Select **Assign a workspace**.

## Unassign a workspace from a pipeline stage

You can unassign a workspace from any pipeline stage. If you want to assign a different workspace to a pipeline stage, you'll first have to unassign the current workspace from that stage.

To unassign a workspace from a pipeline stage, follow these steps:

1. Open the pipeline.

2. In the stage you want to unassign the workspace from, select **settings**.

3. From the *settings* menu, select **Unassign workspace**.

4. In the *Unassign workspace* dialogue box, select **Unassign**.

## Limitations

* The workspace must be a [new workspace experience](../collaborate-share/service-create-the-new-workspaces.md).

* You must be an admin of the workspace.

* The workspace is not assigned to any other pipeline.

* The workspace must reside on aâ€¯[Premium capacity](../admin/service-premium-what-is.md).

* You cannot assign a workspace with [Power BI samples](../create-reports/sample-datasets.md) to a pipeline stage.

* You cannot assign a [template app](./../connect-data/service-template-apps-create.md#create-the-template-workspace) workspace.

* When assigning a workspace, if a report and a paginated report from an adjacent stage have the same name, the assignment will fail.
