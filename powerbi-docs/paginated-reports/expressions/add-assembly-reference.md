# Add an assembly reference to a paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> Custom assemblies are not supported in paginated reports on Power BI. Consider converting logic from custom assembly to [embedded code](./custom-code-and-assembly-references-in-expressions.md). For examples of alternatives to consider, check [assembly alternatives](https://github.com/chmitch/ssrs-assembly-alternatives).
