# Publish a paginated report to the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-paginated-yes-service-no-desktop](../includes/applies-yes-paginated-yes-service-no-desktop.md)] 

In this article, you learn about publishing a paginated report to the Power BI service by uploading it from your local computer. You can upload paginated reports to your My Workspace or any other workspace, as long as the workspace is in a Premium capacity or you have a Premium Per User (PPU) license. Look for the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the workspace name. 

## Requirements

- A [Power BI Pro](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md) license, or [Premium Per User (PPU)](../admin/service-premium-per-user-faq.yml) license, and write access to a workspace in aâ€¯Power BI Premium capacity.
- If your report data source is on premises, you need to install a gateway. Read more about [on-premises gateways](../connect-data/service-gateway-onprem.md). After you upload the report, you connect to the on-premises data source by using the gateway.

## Add a workspace to a Premium capacity

If the workspace doesn't have the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the name, you need to add the workspace to a Premium capacity. 

1. Select **Workspaces**, select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the workspace name, then select **Edit workspace**.

    ![Select Edit workspace](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-edit-workspace.png)

1. In the **Edit workspace** dialog box, expand **Advanced**, then slide **Dedicated capacity** to **On**.

    ![Select Dedicated capacity](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-edit-workspace-dialog.png)

   You may not be able to change it. If not, then contact your Power BI Premium capacity admin to give you assignment rights to add your workspace to a Premium capacity.

## From Report Builder, publish a paginated report to the Power BI Service

1. Create a new paginated report or open an existing paginated report from the Power BI Service in Report Builder. If you open an existing paginated report from the service, the **Save** option is disabled because you're updating a report that's live in the Power BI Service.

1. On the Report Builder **File** menu, select **Publish**.

    ![Select the File menu, then Publish.](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-save-as.png)

    If you aren't signed in to Power BI yet, you need to sign in or create an account now. In the upper-right corner of Report Builder, select **Sign in** and complete the steps.

2. In the list of workspaces on the left, select a workspace with the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to its name. Type a **File name** in the box > **Save**. 

    ![Select a Premium workspace](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-select-workspace.png)

4. Open the Power BI service in a browser and browse to the Premium workspace where you published the paginated report. On the **Reports** tab, you see your report.

5. Select the paginated report to open it in the Power BI service. If it has parameters, you need to select them before you can view the report.

6. If your report data source is on premises, read about how to [connect to a gateway](#connect-to-a-gateway) in this article to access the data source.

## From the Power BI service, upload a paginated report

You can also start from the Power BI service and upload a paginated report.

1. Create your paginated report in Report Builder and save it to your local computer.

1. Open the Power BI service in a browser and browse to the Premium workspace where you want to publish the report. Note the diamond icon ![Power BI Premium capacity diamond icon](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/premium-diamond.png) next to the name. 

1. Select **Get data** at the bottom of the nav pane.

6. If your report data source is on premises, read about how to [connect to a gateway](#connect-to-a-gateway) in this article to access the data source.

## Connect to a gateway

As with any other Power BI report, if the paginated report data source is on premises, then you need to create or connect to a gateway to access the data.

1. Next to the report name, select **Manage**.

   ![Manage the paginated report](media/paginated-reports-save-to-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-manage.png)

1. See the Power BI service article [What is an on-premises data gateway](../connect-data/service-gateway-onprem.md) for details and next steps.
