## View culture-sensitive reports in Power BI paginated reports

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-service-no-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-service-no-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

You can now view paginated reports in your local or preferred language on the Power BI service. There are pre-requisites that you should follow in order to be able to leverage this capability. 

##Pre-requisites
[!INCLUDE [power-bi-paginated-prerequisites](../../includes/power-bi-paginated-prerequisites.md)]

Add translations to the PBI dataset: [Translation Builder documentation](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/TranslationsBuilder/blob/main/Docs/Building%20Multi-language%20Reports%20in%20Power%20BI.md) 


##Get Started
Once your PBI dataset contains the data translations, you can view the translated content in the paginated report on the service by setting the language in the browser settings.
