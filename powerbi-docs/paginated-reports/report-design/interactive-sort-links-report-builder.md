# Interactive sort and links in a Power BI paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

  In Web-based environments, you can add a number of features that let your users interact with paginated reports. Your users can change the sort order of values in your report, show or hide items in the report, or click links that go to other reports or Web pages. You can also add a table of contents. Your report users can select items in the table of contents to jump to areas within a report.  
  
 Power BI Report Builder support three types of links with the following actions:  
  
-   **Bookmark links** Jump to other areas within the report.  
  
-   **Hyperlinks** Jump to URLs that specify the address of Web pages.  
  
-   **Drillthrough report links** Jump to other reports in the same workspace of Power BI web portal. For more information, see [Drillthrough reports &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](../../paginated-reports/report-design/drillthrough-reports-report-builder.md). 
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Links that are bound to dataset fields can be vulnerable to tampering for malicious purposes. For more information, see [Secure reports and resources](/sql/reporting-services/security/secure-reports-and-resources).
  
 You can also let your users control report display and content by designing expressions that include parameter references for sort, filter, and visibility. For more information, see [Report parameters &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](../../paginated-reports/parameters/report-parameters-concepts-report-builder.md), [Filter, group, and sort data &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](/sql/reporting-services/report-design/filter-group-and-sort-data-report-builder-and-ssrs), and [Add dataset filters, data region filters, and group filters &#40;Power BI Report Builder&#41;](../../paginated-reports/report-design/add-dataset-filters-data-region-filters-and-group-filters.md).
