# Add an external image to a paginated report (Power BI Report Builder)

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../../includes/applies-yes-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

When you include external images in your paginated report, you must verify that the image exists and that it can be accessed over the internet without requiring authentication. 
 
## To add an external image  
  
1.  In report design view, on the **Insert** tab, select **Image**.  
  
2.  On the design surface, click and then drag a box to the desired size of the image.  
  
3.  On the **General** tab of the **Image Properties** dialog box, type a name in the **Name** text box or accept the default.  
  
4.  (Optional) In the **Tooltip** text box, type text to display when the user hovers over the image in a report rendered for HTML.  
  
5.  In **Select the image source**, select **External**.  
  
    Provide URL to external image in provided text box.  
  
6.  (Optional) Select **Size**, **Visibility**, **Action**, or **Border** to set additional properties for the image report item.  
  
7.  Select **OK**.
