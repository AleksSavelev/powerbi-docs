# Git integration with paginated reports

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-service-yes-report-builder-no-desktop](../includes/applies-yes-service-no-report-builder-no-desktop.md)]

This article walks you through publishing a paginated report and keeping it in sync with your git workspace. Developers can apply their development processes, tools, and best practices.  

## Prerequisites

## Get started

In the Power BI service, navigate to the Workspace that you would like to sync with your git repository by selecting **Workspace** in the left nav.

Select **Workspace Settings** in the Workspace

**Note:** If the branch is new, you will be prompted to **Create and sync**.


Upload your rdl to the workspace on the service. We don't support OneDrive and Sharepoint yet.

Once the file is uploaded, you should see the report and the Git status **Uncommitted** and **Source control**.

:::image type="content" source="media/page-view/paginated-reports-source-control.png" alt-text="Screenshot of status":::

Select **Source Control**. In the source control pane, select the file and commit.

Once you commit the file, the **Git status** will change to **Sync**

:::image type="content" source="media/page-view/paginated-reports-git-status-sync.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Git Synced":::

You will see a folder in your git repository which contains the .rdl and 2 .json files. You may have to refresh your repository.

## Considerations and limitations

1. The recommendation is to always publish/upload the paginated report to the service and use git.  

2. The paginated report will not render if you start with the files in git.  

3. When deleting the paginated report from git, delete the entire folder and not just the RDL report.  

4. If you move the paginated report to a different workspace, it will still be connected to the original dataset. If the dataset needs to be updated, please update the dataset in Power BI Report builder.
