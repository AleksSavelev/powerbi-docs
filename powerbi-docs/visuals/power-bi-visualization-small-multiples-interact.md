## Scroll in a small multiple

Small multiples may contain more individual charts that can fit in the grid. If so, you can scroll down to see the rest of your categories.

If a categorical X axis has many categories, you also see a scroll bar for each copy of that axis. Scrolling on that axis moves them all together. If you are using a scroll wheel, hold Shift to scroll the categorical axes.

## Select data to cross-highlight

You can select different subsets of data by selecting different parts of the visual.

### Select data points

Hover over the data point on one multiple to show the tooltip in that multiple, as well as a guide line on the x axis for line charts. Select that data point to cross-highlight other visuals by both the axis value and the small multiple category, as well as dim other multiples.

### Select a categorical axis value

Select a category label to cross-highlight other visuals by that axis value.

### Select a title

Select the title of a multiple to cross-highlight other visuals by the category or combination of categories listed on that subheader.

### Legend

Select a legend category to cross-highlight other visuals and cross-highlight other multiples.


## Sort

A new sort UI lets you to sort multiple different aspects of a visual at once. You can sort by the category, and also by the axis in each multiple.
