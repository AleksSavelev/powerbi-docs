# Customize visualization titles, backgrounds, labels, and legends

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-nyyn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-nyyn.md)]    


In this tutorial, you'll learn a few different ways to customize your visualizations. There are so many options for customizing your visualizations. The best way to learn about them all is by exploring the **Format** pane (select the paint roller icon). To get you started, this article shows you how to customize a visualization title, legend, background, and add a theme.

You can't customize all visualizations. See the [complete list](#visualization-types-that-you-can-customize) of visualizations for details.


## Prerequisites

- The Power BI service or Power BI Desktop

- Retail Analysis Sample report

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing your report with a Power BI colleague requires that you both have individual Power BI Pro licenses or that the report is saved in Premium capacity. See [sharing reports](../collaborate-share/service-share-reports.md).

## Customize visualization titles in reports

To follow along, sign into Power BI Desktop and open the [Retail Analysis Sample](../create-reports/sample-datasets.md) report.

> [!NOTE]
> When you pin a visualization to a dashboard, it becomes a dashboard tile. You can also customize the tiles themselves with [new titles and subtitles, hyperlinks, and resized](../create-reports/service-dashboard-edit-tile.md).

1. Go to the **New Stores** page of the **Retail Analysis Sample** report.

1. Select the **Open Store Count by Open Month and Chain** clustered column chart.

1. In the **Visualizations** pane, select the paint roller icon to reveal the format options.

1. Select **Title** to expand that section.

   ![Screenshot of the Format pane with the paint roller icon called out and an arrow to the Title drop-down.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-format-menu.png)

1. Move the **Title** slider to **On**.

1. To change the title, enter *Store count by month opened* in the **Title text** field.

    ![Screenshot of the Format pane with the Title text entered.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-title.png)

1. Change **Font color** to white and **Background color** to blue.    

    a. Select the drop-down and choose a color from **Theme colors**, **Recent colors**, or **Custom color**.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Font color and Background color options.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-color.png)

    b. Select the drop-down to close the color window.


1. Increase the text size to **16 pt**.

1. The last customization you'll make to the chart title is to align it in the center of the visualization.

    ![Screenshot of the Alignment controls with the Center option selected.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-align.png)

    At this point in the tutorial, your clustered column chart title will look something like this:

    ![Screenshot of the newly configured clustered column chart.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-table.png)

Save the changes you've made and move to the next section.

If you ever need to revert all of the changes, select **Revert to default**, at the bottom of the **Title** customization pane.

![Screenshot of the Revert to default option.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-revert.png)

## Customize visualization backgrounds

With the same clustered column chart selected, expand the **Background** options.

1. Move the **Background** slider to **On**.

1. Select the drop-down and choose a grey color.

1. Change **Transparency** to **74%**.

At this point in the tutorial, your clustered column chart background will look something like this:

![Screenshot of the clustered column chart with background color updated.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-background.png)

Save the changes you've made and move to the next section.

If you ever need to revert all of the changes, select **Revert to default**, at the bottom of the **Background** customization pane.

## Customize visualization legends

1. Open the **Overview** report page and select the **Total Sales Variance by FiscalMonth and District Manager** chart.

1. In the **Visualization** tab, select the paint roller icon to open the Format pane.

1. Expand the **Legend** options:

    ![Screenshot of the Legend card.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-legends.png)

1. Move the **Legend** slider to **On**.

1. Move the legend to the left side of the visualization.

1. Add a legend title by toggling **Title** to **On**.

1. Enter *Manager* in the **Legend name** field.

1. Change **Color** to black.

Save the changes you've made and move to the next section.

If you ever need to revert all of the changes, select **Revert to default**, at the bottom of the **Legend** customization pane.

## Customize total labels for stacked visuals
Stacked visuals can display data labels and total labels. On a stacked column chart, data labels identify the value for each portion of a column. Total labels display the total value for the entire aggregated column. 

Watch Rien add total labels to a stacked chart, and then follow the steps below to try it out yourself.

1. Open the **Overview** report page and select the **Average selling area size by chain and store type** bar chart.

1. In the **Visualization** tab, select ![icon for the stacked bar chart](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-stacked-bar.png) to convert this bar chart to a stacked bar chart. Notice that the visual retains its data labels. 

    ![Screenshot of the new stacked bar chart.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-stacked-chart.png)

1. In the **Visualization** tab, select the paint roller icon to open the Format pane.

1. Move the **Total labels** slider to **On**. 

    ![Screenshot showing Total label slider set to On.](media/power-bi-visualization-customize-title-background-and-legend/power-bi-totals.png)

1. Optionally, format the total labels. In this example, we've changed color to black, increased font size, and opted to display the values as **Thousands**.

## Customize colors using a theme

With report themes you can apply design changes to your entire report, such as using corporate colors, changing icon sets, or applying new default visual formatting. When you apply a report theme, all visuals in your report use the colors and formatting from your selected theme.

To apply a theme to your report, select **Switch theme** from the menu bar. Choose a theme.  The report below uses the **Solar** theme.
