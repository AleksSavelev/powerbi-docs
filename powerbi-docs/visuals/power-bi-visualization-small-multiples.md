# Create small multiples in Power BI (preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-desktop](../includes/yes-desktop.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-service](../includes/yes-service.md)]

Small multiples, or trellising, splits a visual into multiple versions of itself. The versions are presented side by side, with data divided across these versions by a chosen dimension. For example, a small multiple could split a “sales by category” column chart across product lines or regions. In this preview, small multiples have a small set of capabilities, with more coming in later releases.

## Enable the preview feature

On the **File** menu, select **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Preview features**, and select the **Small multiples** check box.

Restart Power BI Desktop, and you're ready to try small multiples.

## Create small multiples

For live connected data models, this feature requires a version of AS which supports the second generation of DAX queries, aka SuperDAX: for tabular models, AS 2016 or newer; and for multidimensional models, AS 2019 or newer.

Currently, you can create small multiples on bar, column, line, and area charts. 

To get started, create one of the above visuals and choose a field along which you'd like to partition its data. Drag that field into the **Small multiples** well in the Fields section of the Visualizations pane. 
Your chart splits into a 2×2 grid, with the data divided along your chosen dimension. The grid fills with the small multiples charts. They're sorted by your chosen sort order, from left to right, then top to bottom.

You see that the axes are synchronized. There's one Y axis at the left of each row, and one X axis at the bottom of each column.

Now that you've created small multiples, see how you [Interact with small multiples in Power BI (preview)](power-bi-visualization-small-multiples-interact.md).

## Format a small multiples visual

Some new options in the formatting pane let you control the look and feel of the grid.

### Change the grid dimensions

You can change the dimensions of the grid in the Grid layout card:

:::image type="content" source="media/power-bi-visualization-small-multiples/small-multiple-grid-layout-card.png" alt-text="Small multiple grid layout card.":::

The default is a 2×2 grid of small multiples, but you can adjust the number of rows and columns to up to 6×6. Any multiples that don't fit in that grid load as you scroll down.


### Adjust the small multiples titles

As with other visual titles, you can adjust the style and position of the small multiple titles in the **Small multiple title** card.

## Preview limitations

While the feature is in preview, we're constantly working on making sure it interacts well with the rest of our features. Here are some current limitations.

### Fields pane

- Date and other continuous hierarchies: Say you have a visual like a line chart with a date hierarchy in the X axis. When you make small multiples out of it, Power BI converts that axis from a continuous to a categorical axis.
- Show items with no data: The option still exists, but the behavior may not align with your expectations.

### Visual interactions

- Scroll to load more on the Categorical axis: In standard visuals with many categories in the axis, when you scroll to the end of the axis, the visual loads more categories. Currently, a small multiples visual doesn't load more categories.
- Sort small multiples by measure: Sorting on small multiples is new functionality. You may be expecting to sort your small multiples by a measure. Currently, you can only sort your multiples by the field's natural sort order.
- Right click/context menu -> Analyze: disabled for now.
- Right click/context menu -> Summarize: disabled for now.
- Selecting multiple data points with rectangular select: disabled for now.
- Axis zoom: disabled for now.
- Accessibility: You can adjust keyboard navigation and screen readouts to better support the new “grid” layer that small multiples bring to visuals. Some behavior is missing, such as keyboard navigation through the categorical axis scrollbar.

### Formatting options

**General**

- Responsive toggle: the option still exists, but the behavior may not align with your expectations. Since many mobile accommodations are tied to this toggle, the mobile experience also closely mirrors the experience you find in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service.
- High-density sampling: for line charts, the high-density sampling toggle still exists, but it isn't currently supported by small multiples.

**Axis**

- Concatenate labels: disabled for now.

**Total labels**

- Total labels for stacked charts: disabled for now.

**Zoom slider**

- Zoom sliders: disabled for now.

**Analytics pane** 

- Trend lines: disabled for now.
- Forecasting: disabled for now.

Dynamic formatting for highlight labels: currently not supported.

## Authoring in the Power BI service

Authoring small multiples on the web isn't supported while the feature is in preview. You can view a report with a small multiples visual, and even format the visual. But you can't convert a standard visual to a small multiples visual in the Power BI service. A visual has to already have a field in the small multiples field well, or the small multiples well won't show up for that visual.
