# Format column and bar charts

[!INCLUDE [applies-yes-desktop-yes-service](../includes/applies-yes-desktop-yes-service.md)]

You have a number of options for formatting column and bar charts in Power BI. These features aim to provide you with greater flexibility and freedom in presenting your data, to make your insights stand out.

Explore these new capabilities to create compelling narratives with your data in Power BI. Here are details about the features.

## Layout enhancements

- **Apply settings to all or series**: Apply formatting options globally across all categories, or tailor them for each unique individual series.

- **Transparency control**: Adjust the fill color transparency to balance of visibility and design. 

- **Border customization**: You can add borders precision, choosing a distinct color, or match it to the column’s fill. Define both the border’s width and transparency. 

- **Layout**: We've moved several design elements.

  - The **Spacing** card is now the **Layout** card.
  - We relocated the **Reverse Order** toggle that allows you to invert series.
  - We introduced **Sort by Value**, **Space between categories**, and **Space between series**.
  - For clustered column and bar charts, you have the option to **Erode** or **Explode** the stacked series.

- **Advanced ribbon settings**: Highlight a series or create visual continuity with an array of options including matching series color or choosing a color selection, transparency, border color matching or color selection, border width, and border spacing.
