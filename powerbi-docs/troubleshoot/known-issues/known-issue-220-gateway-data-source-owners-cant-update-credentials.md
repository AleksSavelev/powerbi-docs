# Known issue #220 - Gateway data source owners can't update data source credentials

If you have owner permission but no gateway level permission on a data source, you may not be able to update the credentials for that data source.  The page will just show as loading and the credentials won't update.

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️ Power BI Gateway

**Status:** Fixed: September 2, 2022

**Problem area:** Gateway

## Symptoms

To update the credentials for a data source, you go to **Settings** for the data source.  When you select the **Save** button, the page shows the spinning loading wheel, and doesn't change the credentials.

## Solutions and workarounds

As a workaround, grant the affected user gateway admin permission to allow them to update credentials. When the fix is released, this article will be updated.
