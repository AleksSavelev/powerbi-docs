## Additional information

**Existing tenant migration requests**

We've resumed migrating tenants for customers who have already requested a migration.

**New tenant migration requests**

For customers who want to request a new tenant migration, we'll start accepting requests soon.  The present ETA for accepting tenant migration requests in June 1, 2023. This will occur after we have completed our backlog of existing requests. Out of an abundance of caution, we note this date could change if unexpected results are discovered. We apologize for the inconvenience of our current inability to provide a guaranteed migration timeline.
