# Known issue - Sign in fails for securely embedded reports using Chrome browser

You might not be able to sign in using the Chrome browser to a Power BI report that was embedded using the “Secure embed” method. After selecting **Sign in**, the browser opens a new tab.  The new tab doesn’t redirect, doesn't load the embedded report, and remains stuck on the **Sign in** page.

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️ Power BI

**Status:** Open

**Problem area:** Publish Content

## Symptoms

When trying to view a securely embedded report using the Chrome browser, you aren't automatically signed in.  You can't view the report without refreshing the page.

## Solutions and workarounds

To view the report, use the Microsoft Edge browser or refresh the page in the Chrome browser.
