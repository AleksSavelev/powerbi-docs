# Known issue - Sign in fails for securely embedded reports using Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser

You might not be able to sign in using the Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser to a Power BI report that was embedded using the “Secure embed” method. After selecting **Sign in**, the browser opens a new tab.  The new tab doesn’t redirect, doesn't load the embedded report, and remains stuck on the **Sign in** page.

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️ Power BI

**Status:** Open

**Problem area:** Publish Content

## Symptoms

When trying to view a securely embedded report using the Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser, you aren't automatically signed in.  You can't view the report without refreshing the page.

## Solutions and workarounds
