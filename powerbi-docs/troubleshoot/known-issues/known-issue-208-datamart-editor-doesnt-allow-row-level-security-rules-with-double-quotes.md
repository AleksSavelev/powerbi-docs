# Known issue #208 - Datamart editor doesn't allow saving row-level security (RLS) rules that contain double quotes in the string filter

When using the Datamart editor, you can create rules for row-level security (RLS) to specify security roles that will restrict the data shown.  In **Manage Roles** > **Row security settings** > **Create** > **Add filters**, you create a rule that uses a string filter.  If you include a double quote in the string filter, you can't save the filter.
