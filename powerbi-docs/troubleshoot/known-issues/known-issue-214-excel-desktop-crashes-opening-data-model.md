# Description of known issue #214

You can create an Excel workbook that contains a PowerPivot data model and store it in either OneDrive Business or SharePoint.  You can then schedule and run a successful refresh through the Power BI Service.  If you then try to open the Excel workbook in Excel Desktop, the workbook won't open, resulting in either a crash or error message.

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️ Power BI Service ✔️ Excel Integration

**Status:** Fixed: July 25, 2022

**Problem area:** Consume and View


## Symptoms

When opening an Excel workbook that contains a data model that was refreshed by the Power BI Service, the Excel workbook will either:

## Solutions and workarounds

As a workaround, use Excel Online or Excel for the web to view the workbook.
