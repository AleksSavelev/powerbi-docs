# Known issue - Decomposition tree visual first level is incorrectly expanded

**APPLIES TO:** ✔️ Power BI Service

**Status:** Fixed: July 6, 2022

**Problem area:** Consume and View

## Description of problem

In Power BI Desktop, you can create a report with a decomposition tree visual that only shows the root level (other levels are collapsed). Once you publish the report to the service, the first level in the decomposition tree visual is incorrectly expanded (which shows the next level).  You also can't collapse the expanded level because the header is hidden.

## Symptoms

The first level in a collapsed decomposition tree visual is incorrectly expanded.

## Solutions and workarounds

No workarounds at this time.  When the fix is released, this article will be updated.
