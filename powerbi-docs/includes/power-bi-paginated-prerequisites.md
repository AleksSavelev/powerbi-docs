- You don't need any license to [download Power BI Report Builder](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086513) from the Microsoft Download Center for free.
- You need a [Power BI Pro](../fundamentals/service-self-service-signup-for-power-bi.md) or [Premium Per User (PPU)](../admin/service-premium-per-user-faq.yml) license to publish a report to the service.
- You can publish and share paginated reports in your My Workspace or in other workspaces, as long as the workspace is in a Power BI Premium capacity and you have write access to the workspace. 
- A Power BI admin needs to enable paginated reports in the [Premium capacities section](../admin/service-admin-premium-workloads.md#paginated-reports) of the Power BI admin portal.
