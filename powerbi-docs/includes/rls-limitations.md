## Considerations and limitations

You can see the current limitations for row-level security on cloud models here:

* If you previously defined roles and rules in the Power BI service, you must re-create them in Power BI Desktop.
* You can define RLS only on the datasets created with Power BI Desktop. If you want to enable RLS for datasets created with Excel, you must convert your files into Power BI Desktop (PBIX) files first. [Learn more](../connect-data/desktop-import-excel-workbooks.md).
* Service principals can't be added to an RLS role. Accordingly, RLS wonâ€™t be applied for apps using a service principal as the final effective identity.
* Only Import and DirectQuery connections are supported. Live connections to Analysis Services are handled in the on-premises model.
* The Test as role/View as role feature doesn't work for DirectQuery models with single sign-on (SSO) enabled.
