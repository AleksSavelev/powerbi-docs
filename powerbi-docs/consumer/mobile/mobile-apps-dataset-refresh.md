# Refresh datasets from the Power BI apps for mobile devices

As a dataset owner, you can manually refresh your datasets, as well as view dataset info, directly from your Power BI mobile app. In addition, whenever a dataset you own has a refresh failure, you receive a notification on your mobile app, so you can take immediate action to ensure that your users see the most current data.

## View dataset info and refresh a dataset

Use the following steps to view dataset info and refresh a dataset

1. Navigate to workspace where the dataset is located and tap the **Datasets** tab. All the datasets you have access to in that workspace will be listed. Dataset refresh failures are indicated by a warning symbol, as shown in the following image.

1. Tap the dataset you want to refresh. The Dataset info page opens, showing some details about the dataset. If there was a refresh failure, you can tap Show more to dispay failure details. You can copy the details for future reference.
3.	Tap **Refresh now**. This button is disabled if a refresh is already in progress.

## Respond to a refresh failure notification

If you received a notification of refresh failure notification, tap the notification. The dataset info pane will open. There you find the dataset info and the Refresh now button that you can use to trigger the dataset refresh.
