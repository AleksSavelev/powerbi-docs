# Choose a start-up view on your Power BI mobile app

Ordinarily, when you open your Power BI mobile app, you land on the app’s home page and then navigate to the item you want to view. If you have a report, dashboard, scorecard, or app that you always go to when you open your app, you can save time by making it your app's *launch item*. A launch item is an item your mobile app displays whenever you open the app. By making your most frequently viewed item the launch item, you won’t have to waste time navigating to it every time you open the app – rather, it’ll be the first thing you see when the app opens.

## Set up a launch item

To create launch item, open the item you want to see when the app opens. Tap **More options (…)**, and choose **Set as launch item**.

If you don’t see the **Set as launch item** option, it means that the launch item feature is not enabled on your device. To enable the feature, see [Manage your launch item](#manage-your-launch-item).
