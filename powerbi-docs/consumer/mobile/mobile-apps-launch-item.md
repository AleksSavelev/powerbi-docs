# Choose a start-up view on your Power BI mobile app

By default, when you launch your Power BI mobile app, it opens to the app's home page. However, if you have a specific report, dashboard, scorecard, or app that you always go to when you open the mobile app, you [can specify that item as the *launch item*](#set-up-a-launch-item). A launch item is the item your mobile app will display first whenever you open the app. Making your most frequently viewed item the launch item saves you time - you won't have to waste time navigating to it every time you open the app. Rather, it'll be the first thing you see when you open your app.

Your organization can also create launch items for groups of users. If your organization has created a launch item for you, when you start up your app, you'll see an option to accept or decline the organization's selection. If you accept, the organization-defined launch item will display, and from then on you'll be taken to that item whenever you open the app. If you decline, you'll either be taken to the app home page, or, if you have defined a launch item for yourself, to your self-defined launch item.

You can always change your mind and accept the org's launch item suggestion in the [Launch item settings](#manage-your-launch-item).

## Set up a launch item

To mark an item as the launch item, open the desired item, tap **More options (â€¦)**, and choose **Set as launch item**.

Once you set an item as the launch item, it will be readily identifiable by an icon.

## Change your launch item

If you want to change your launch item, just open the desired item and mark it as [described above](#set-up-a-launch-item). The previous item will automatically be removed as the launch item.

## Remove your launch item

If you want stop using an item as the launch item, just go to the item, open the **More options (...)** menu, and tap **Remove as launch item**.

When you remove the launch item, the next time you start up your app, it will open to the home page, unless your organization has suggested a launch item for you. In that case, you'll see an option to accept or decline the organization's selection. If you accept, the organization-defined launch item will display, and from then on you'll be taken to that item whenever you open the app. If you decline, you'll be taken to the app home page.

## Manage your launch item

You can manage your launch items in the Launch items section of your app's settings. In the settings you'll see the item you've marked as the launch item, if any. If the item is selected and the toggle is on, it means that the item is currently active as the launch item. If the toggle is off, it means that the launch item is currently inactive.

If your organization has configured a launch item for you it will be listed in the settings. You can toggle back and forth between an item you've chosen as the launch item and the item that the organization has configured.
