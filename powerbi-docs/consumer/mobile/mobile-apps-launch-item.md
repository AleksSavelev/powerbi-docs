# Choose a start-up view on your Power BI mobile app

If you have a report, dashboard, scorecard, or app that you always go to when you open your app, you can save time by making it your app's *launch item*. A launch item is the item your mobile app displays whenever you open the app. By making your most frequently viewed item the launch item, you won’t have to waste time navigating to it every time you open the app – rather, it’ll be the first thing you see when the app opens.

## Set up a launch item

To create a launch item, open the item you want to get to whenever you open the app. Tap **More options (…)**, and choose **Set as launch item**.

Once you set an item the launch item, it will be identifiable in the app by an icon.

## Pick a different launch item

If you want to change your launch item, just open the desired item and mark it as described above. The previous item will automatically be removed as the launch item.

## Removing a launch item

If you want stop using an item as the launch item, just go to the item, open the **More options (...)** menu and tap **Remove as launch item**.

When you remove the launch item, the next time you start up your app, it will open to the home page, unless your organization has set up a launch item for you. In that case, you'll be asked either to approve the configuration, after which the app will navigate to the item, or to decline in which case the app will open to the home page.
