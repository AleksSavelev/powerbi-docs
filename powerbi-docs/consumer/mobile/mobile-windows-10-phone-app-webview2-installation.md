# Install WebView2

>[!NOTE]
>Power BI mobile app support for **phones using Windows 10 Mobile** has been discontinued as of March 16, 2021. [Learn more](/legal/powerbi/powerbi-mobile/power-bi-mobile-app-end-of-support-for-windows-phones)

The Power BI app for Windows brings Power BI to your Windows device. You get up-to-date, touch-enabled access to your business information. You can interact with all the Power BI reports, dashboards, and apps that are available to you in the Power BI service - both those that you've [created](../../fundamentals/service-get-started.md) yourself as well as those that have been created by others and shared with you. All this from the Power BI app for Windows.

## Why am I getting this message?
The most likely reason for getting this error is that WebView2 isn't installed on your device. The Power BI storytelling add-in requires WebView2 to run Power BI in PowerPoint. If WebView2 isn't installed, you need to install it before you'll be able to use the add-in.

How to install WebView2?
It takes just a minute to install WebView2. You can get and install it from Download Microsoft Edge WebView2.

When the installation is done, check to make sure WebView2 is installed. Open the add-in side menu, select Security Info. The Security Info window will appear.

If the Security Info window says Runtime: Microsoft Edge, WebView2 is installed.

 Note

After installing WebView2, you might need to close and re-open all Office applications.
