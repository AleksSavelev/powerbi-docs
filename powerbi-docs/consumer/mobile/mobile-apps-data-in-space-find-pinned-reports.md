This article describes how to find and access Power Bi data that has been pinned to locations in the real world using the Data in space feature [link to overview].

To perform these actions, you must be a Data in space **Viewer** or **Writer** [link to overview].

1. To discover reports pinned around you, tap the mobile app’s camera icon to open the scanner.

2. Choose **AR scanner** and tap **Start scanning**.

    >[!NOTE]
    > If you don't see the AR scanner option, it means either that you're not allowed to find pinned reports, or that your organization isn't using the Data in space functionality.

1. Scan the area around you by moving your camera slowly from side to side. It may take a few moments for the scanner to find the pinned reports. When the scanner detects pinned reports, they'll show up as cards suspended in three dimensional space at the locations they've been pinned at. The cards show an up-to-date, current view of the report. The data you see depends on your Power BI permissions.

    At the bottom of your view, there is the report locator. The dotseach dot there on the concentric circles at the bottom of the scanner screen shows the reportir approximate position in relation to the direction you're facing. Notice that there might be reports located behind you.

    Reports that you don't have access to will appear in the camera view, but instead of as thumbnails bearing the Power BI logo with data you will see a message explaining that you do not have access.

    Tap the card to request access.
    
1. Tap a card to open the report.

    The report image on the thumbnail shows an up-to-date view of the report, so if all you need to do is glance at the report, for example, to check KPIs, you can zoom in on the card by double-tapping it – there's no need to actually open the report itself.

1. Double tap to bring the card to the center of the screen and have a better look of the thumbnail. Double tap to send it back to its anchor.
