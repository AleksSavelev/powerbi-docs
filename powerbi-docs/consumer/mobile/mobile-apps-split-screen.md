If your iPad or Android tablet supports it, you can view and interact with your Power BI data while working side by side with another app.

### Opening two apps side by side

* **Android tablets**: Check your tablet's documentation to see how to open apps in split-screen mode on your Android device.
* **iPads**: See [support.apple.com](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad08c9970c/ipados) for instructions about opening two apps side by side in Split View. Split View is supported for iPads running iPadOS 13 and greater.

### Working with two apps side by side

Once your apps are open side by side, you can adjust the size of the screens by dragging the dividing line between the apps to the right or left.

Working side by side with another app works best with reports that have been optimized for viewing on mobile devices. If you are a report creator, consider creating a mobile-optimized layout for your report. See [Optimize Power BI reports for the mobile app](../../create-reports/desktop-create-phone-report.md) for details.
