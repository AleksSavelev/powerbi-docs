# Customer intent: As a Power BI customer or potential customer, I want to get a definition of a Power BI consumer so I know if I am a consumer (versus designer, admin, creator, or dev) and, as a consumer, what I can accomplish with the Power BI service.

# Collaborate using data in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

Many of us spend a lot of time collaborating in Microsoft Teams. With Power BI, you can get insights into where you're spending your time and how you and your team collaborate.  By reviewing this data, you and your team can plan improved ways of working to be more responsive, agile, and productive.

To start getting insights about collaboration in Microsoft Teams, follow these steps.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app first? [install the app and then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

2. Go to the **Create** tab and select **Analyze your Teams** data.

4. Explore your personal usage in the automatically generated report.
5. Explore engagement in the Teams you participate in.

The report gets saved in your Power BI account and stays refreshed. You can keep coming back every few days to see how actions you take change the trends. When working in a Teams team, itâ€™s great to discuss the data and ways your team can improve.
