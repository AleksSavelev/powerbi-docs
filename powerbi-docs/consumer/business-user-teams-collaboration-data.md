# Customer intent: As a Power BI customer or potential customer, I want to get a definition of a Power BI consumer so I know if I am a consumer (versus designer, admin, creator, or dev) and, as a consumer, what I can accomplish with the Power BI service.

Many users spend significant amounts of time collaborating in Microsoft Teams. With Power BI, you can get additional insights into where you're spending your time and how the teams you use collaborate.  By reviewing this data, individuals and teams can plan improved ways of working to be more responsive, agile, and productive.
To start getting insights about collaboration in Microsoft Teams, follow these steps:
1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams
2. Go to the Create tab
3. Select Analyze your Teams data
4. Explore your personal usage in the automatically generated report 
5. Explore engagement in the Teams you participate in
The report gets saved in your Power BI account and stays refreshed. You can keep coming back every few days to see how actions you take change the trends. When working in a Team, itâ€™s great to discuss the data and ways your team can improve.
