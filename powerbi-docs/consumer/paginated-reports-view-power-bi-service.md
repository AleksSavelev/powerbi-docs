# View a paginated report in the Power BI service

In this article, you learn about viewing a paginated report to the Power BI service. Paginated reports are reports created in Report Builder and can be uploaded to any  workspace.

Paginated reports have their own icon :::image type="icon" source="media/paginated-reports-view-power-bi-service/power-bi-paginated-report-icon.png":::.

You can also export paginated reports to many formats:

- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- PDF (and [Accessible PDF, or PDF/UA](../report-server/rendering-extension-support.md))
- Comma-separated values
- XML
- Web archive (.mhtml)
