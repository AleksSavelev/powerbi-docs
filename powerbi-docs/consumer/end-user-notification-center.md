# View Power BI notifications

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yynn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yynn.md)]


The Power BI service keeps track of events that have occurred since the last time you logged in. This includes updates to apps, alerts that have been triggered on dashboards, informational about Power BI events and meetings, and new content added to workspaces. A sequential list of these events is saved in your *notification center*. 

When you're ready to review your notifications, select the bell icon  ![Notification center bell icon.](./media/end-user-notification-center/power-bi-bell.png). Your notifications are listed with most-recent at the top. Viewed items are shown in grey and unviewed items are highlighted and have a yellow corner.

Watch Amanda review, manage, and respond to notifications. Then follow the instructions below the video to try it out yourself.

## View your notifications
When you log in to Power BI, any new notifications that you've received while you were offline are added to your feed. If you do have new notifications, Power BI displays a yellow bubble with the number of new items above the notification center icon. Since the notification center is part of the Power BI service top menu bar, you can open your notifications from most areas of the Power BI service, including: Home, Recents, dashboards, reports, apps, workspaces, and the Power BI Q&A screen.

Notifications are sent to you for a variety of reasons, and often the same notification is also sent to you via email. 
- when an app has been updated and the newer version is available
- when new content (e.g., dashboard, report) has been added to a workspace
- when [an alert](end-user-alerts.md) has been triggered (Alerts can be set in the Power BI service and also in the Power BI mobile apps.)
)
- and more


   
1. In the Power BI service menu bar, select the bell icon. In this example, the user has two new notifications since the last time they opened the notification center.

2. Notifications are displayed with the most-recent on top and unread messages highlighted. Notifications are retained for 90 days, unless you delete them sooner or reach the maximum limit of 100.

3. Read the notification and take action. Most notifications contain one or more active links.  The example below contains a link to a dashboard.

1. When you no longer need a notification, dismiss it by selecting the X icon.    

 
## How to cancel a notification
Some notifications are sent automatically by the Power BI service. Other notifications are created by your colleagues or by you. All notifications can be deleted from the notification center before of after you read them. But, if you're receiving certain notifications too often, or you just don't need the information any longer, there are ways to cancel the delivery. 

For notifications created by you or your colleagues, you can cancel the notifications without deleting the content it references. For example, to stop receiving an alert each time your "Total daily sales" rises above $100, [edit or cancel the alert](end-user-alerts.md) from the dashboard. If your colleague created the alert notification, contact them and ask to be removed.
