# Dashboards for business users of the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

A Power BI *dashboard* is a single page, often called a canvas, that uses visualizations to tell a story. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most important elements of that story.

The visualizations on the dashboard are called *tiles* and are *pinned* to the dashboard by report designers. In most cases, selecting a tile takes you to the report page where the visualization was created. If you're new to Power BI, start with [Power BI basic concepts](end-user-basic-concepts.md) to get a good foundation.

>To view dashboards that colleagues share with you, you must have Power BI Pro or Premium. For more information, see [Power BI license types](end-user-license.md).

The visualizations on a dashboard come from reports, and each report is based on one dataset. You can think of a dashboard as an entryway into the underlying reports and datasets. Select a visualization to take you to the report that was used to create it.

## Advantages of dashboards

Dashboards are a wonderful way to monitor your business, find answers, and see your most important metrics at a glance. The visualizations on a dashboard can come from one or more underlying datasets or reports. A dashboard can combine on-premises and cloud data, which provides a consolidated view regardless of where the data lives.

A dashboard isn't just a pretty picture, it's an interactive canvas. The tiles update as the underlying data changes.

## Dashboards versus reports for Power BI business users

How you interact with Power BI depends on your job role. As a consumer or business user, you receive content, like dashboards, reports, and apps, from colleagues who are designers. Reports can be confused with dashboards because they're both canvases filled with visualizations, but there are major differences from a Power BI business user's point of view.
