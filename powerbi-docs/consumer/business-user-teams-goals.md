# Customer intent: As a Power BI customer or potential customer, I want to get a definition of a Power BI consumer so I know if I am a consumer (versus designer, admin, creator, or dev) and, as a consumer, what I can accomplish with the Power BI service.

Teams benefit from having clear and measurable objectives. This helps the team stay on track, promoting accountability, alignment, and visibility. By tracking progress towards key objectives, the team can engage in creative and agile decision-making that helps achieve objectives faster. 
Goals in Power BI help you curate their metrics that matter, assign them to the right people, and track over time. You can manually enter and update goals or automatically update goals from data in reports. 
It takes just a minute to create a goal in Power BI. Each goal has a name, owner, the current value, the target, and a status. You can even add start and end dates for the goal. Sub-goals help you track key objectives that are needed to support a bigger goal. 
How to create your first goal in a scorecard
Its simple to start tracking goals by creating a scorecard, follow these steps:

1. Open Power BI in Teams
2. Go to the Goals Hub
3. Create a scorecard
4. Create a goal in the scorecard
5. Save 
Once you’ve saved your scorecard and the goals it contains, you can share with your team by adding it to a meeting, channel, or chat as a tab or as a link in the meeting chat.

Tracking goals with your team
Together with your colleagues, you can quickly track and update your goals. To keep your goals top of mind, add them as tabs to your channels and meeting. Follow these steps:

1. Open a channel or meeting
2. Add at a tab for Power BI 
3. Pick a scorecard
4. Press save
Give your colleagues permissions to update the scorecard using the share option.
Now in send a message to you colleagues with a link to the scorecard so they can keep it up to date. 

Make tracking goals part of your team rhythm
Keeping goals up to date is made easier with just a little more work. Here are a few capabilities to explore:

• Use check-ins for goals to share context about goals. By encouraging and reviewing check-ins on goals, your team can share the ‘why’ behind the numbers so they’re visible to everyone.
• Automatically update your goals current value. By connecting your goal to a report, whenever the data in the report refreshes, the goal’s current value is automatically kept up to date. 
• Set the goal status automatically.  By creating automated rules to set the status of goals, the goal’s status always reflects the data correctly.
These capabilities help your team save time by eliminating manual updates and helps keep scorecards fully updated. 

Find all your goals in the Goals Hub
Each project and organization can have its own goals. You can find all your goals in one place in the goals hub that is part of the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams. Here’s how to find it.

1. Open the Power BI app for Teams from the Teams left rail
2. Navigate to Home tab
