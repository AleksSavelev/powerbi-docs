# Copy a visual and then paste it into another application

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyyn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyyn.md)]

Have you ever wanted to share an image from a Power BI report or dashboard? Now you can copy the visual and paste it into any other application that supports pasting. Copy an important visual and paste it into an email message, Word, PowerPoint, another Power BI report, and many more applications.

When you copy a static image of a visual, you get a copy of the visual along with the metadata. This includes:
* link back to the Power BI report or dashboard
* title of the report or dashboard
* notice if the image contains confidential information
* last updated time stamp
* filters applied to the visual

### Copy the visual
The process is almost identical for copying a visual from a dashboard or from a report. Only the first step varies. 

1. Navigate to the report or dashboard that has the image that you want to copy.

2. Copy the visual.
    - On a dashboard, from the upper right corner of the visual, select **More actions (...)** and choose **Copy visual as image**. 

        :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-copy-dash.png" alt-text="Copy visual as image option displayed in dropdown menu"::: 

    - On a report page, from the upper right corner of the visual, select the icon for **Copy as image with caption**. 

        :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-copy-icon.png" alt-text="Copy visual as image icon displayed":::
    
3. If there is a data sensitivity label applied to the report that contains the visual, you'll receive a warning. For more information, see [Data that has been labeled as confidential or sensitive](#data-that-has-been-labeled-as-confidential-or-sensitive), below. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-sensitive-dashboard.png" alt-text="A warning message about sensitive data.":::

4. When the **Image with caption copied** dialog appears, select **Copy**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-image-copied.png" alt-text="Image of the Image with caption copied dialog.":::

5. After your visual is copied, paste it into another application using **Ctrl + V** or **right-click** > **Paste**. In the screenshot below, we've pasted the visual into Microsoft Word.

## Data that has been labeled as confidential or sensitive

If there is a data sensitivity label applied to the report containing the visual, you'll receive a warning when you select the copy icon.

And, a sensitivity label will be added to the metadata below the pasted visual.

## Considerations and troubleshooting

   ![copy not available](media//end-user-copy-paste/power-bi-copy-grey.png)


Q: Why is the Copy icon disabled on a visual?    
A: We currently support native Power BI visuals and certified custom visuals. There is limited support for certain visuals including: 
- ESRI and other map visuals 
- Python visuals 
- R visuals 
- PowerApps visuals   

A: The ability to copy a visual can be turned off by your IT department or Power BI administrator.

Q: Why is my visual not pasting correctly?  
A: There are limitations for custom visuals and animated visuals.

Q: Can I to copy a visual from my embedded Power BI report?  
A: *Copy visual* is supported only in the **embed for your organization** scenario. It isn't available in the **embed for your customers** scenario.
