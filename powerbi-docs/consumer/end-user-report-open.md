# View a report in the Power BI service for business users

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yynn](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yynn.md)]

A Power BI report is one or more pages of organized visuals. Power BI designers create reports and [share them directly](../collaborate-share/end-user-shared-with-me.md) with business users, or add them to an [app](end-user-apps.md). You must have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User license to open a report that has been shared with you, unless the report is stored in [Premium capacity](end-user-license.md#identify-content-hosted-in-premium-capacity). A user with any Power BI license can have access to reports stored in Premium capacity or in their own My workspace. For more information, see [Licenses and subscriptions for business users](end-user-license.md).

Explore the following guidance to learn how to open a report from the Browse page and from a dashboard.

## Open a report that's been shared with you

Power BI designers can share a report with you by sending an email link or by adding the report to your Power BI content. These reports are located under **Shared with me** in the **Browse** tab.

1. Open the Power BI service (app.powerbi.com), and sign in if you're prompted.

2. On the navigation pane, select **Browse**, and on the **Browse** page, select **Shared with me**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-share.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Browse page and Shared with me is outlined.":::

3. The report icon :::image type="icon" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report-icon.png"::: is displayed next to the report name. Open the **Sales and Marketing Sample** report.

     :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report-sample.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Sales and Marketing Sample report from the Shared with me list.":::

4. Notice the tabs along the left side. Each tab represents a report page. Select the **YTD Category** tab to open the **YTD Category Trend Analysis** page.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report-open.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the YTD Category Trend Analysis page open." lightbox="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-report-open.png":::

5. Expand the **Filters** pane along the right side. Filters that are applied to this report page, or to the entire report, are displayed here. You can change these filters to see the impact on your visuals and report.

6. Hover over a visual to show the actions you can perform. To see the filters applied to a specific visual, select the filter icon.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-visual-filters.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing filters for the selected visual.":::

7. You can also change the display (zoom) of the report page. On the action bar, select the **View** icon, and then select **Actual size**. Notice the difference that view option makes in how Power BI displays your report.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-view-actual.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Actual size view.":::

8. On the action bar, select the **View** icon, and then select **Fit to width**. Notice the difference that view option makes in how Power BI displays your report.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-width.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Fit to width view.":::

There are many ways for you to interact with a report to discover insights and make business decisions. Other articles about Power BI reports are available in the table of contents.

## Open a report that's in an app

The apps you receive from colleagues are located on the Home page and in the Apps container on your navigation pane. An [app](end-user-apps.md) is a collection of dashboards and reports that a Power BI designer compiles for you.

You must have a Power BI Pro license to open an app unless the app workspace is stored in [Premium capacity](end-user-license.md#identify-content-hosted-in-premium-capacity). A user with any Power BI license can have access to reports stored in Premium capacity.  

You can follow along in this tutorial with Microsoft sample content.

1. In your browser, go to appsource.microsoft.com.
2. Search for "Sales & Marketing" and select **Microsoft sample - Sales & Marketing**.
3. Select **Get it now** > **Continue** > **Install** to install the app in your Apps container.

4. Go back to Home by selecting **Home** from the navigation pane.

5. Scroll down and select **My Apps**.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-apps-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the My apps section of Power BI Home.":::

6. Select your new **Sales and Marketing** app to open it. Depending on the options set by the app designer, the app opens to a dashboard or a report. This app opens to a dashboard.  

## Open a report from a dashboard

Most dashboard [tiles](end-user-tiles.md) are pinned from reports. Selecting a tile opens the report that was used to create the tile.

1. From the **Sales and Marketing** dashboard, select the *Total Units YTD Variance %* column chart tile.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/end-user-report-open/power-bi-dashboards.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a dashboard and a tile is selected.":::

2. The associated report opens to the *YTD Category Trend Analysis* page because this is where the chart is located in the report.

> [!NOTE]
> Not all tiles lead to a report.
>If you select a tile that was [created with Q&A](end-user-q-and-a.md), the Q&A screen opens.
>If you select a tile that was [created using the dashboard **Add tile** widget](../create-reports/service-dashboard-add-widget.md), a video, website, or other content might open.  

## More ways to open a report

As you get more comfortable navigating the Power BI service, you'll figure out workflows that are best for you. A few other ways to access reports:

- Using [the related content pane](end-user-related.md)
- In an email, when someone [shares with you](../collaborate-share/service-share-reports.md) or you [set an alert](end-user-alerts.md)
- From your Notification center
- From a workspace
