# Create reports from data in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

It’s easy to create Power BI reports with just a few clicks in Microsoft Teams. This article gives a few examples of those quick reports you can create. When you’re ready you can also use tools like Power BI Desktop for more advanced report authoring.

## Create an automatic report from data you have

Say you have a table with data that you'd like to try visualizing in Power BI, maybe from Excel. To create your first report, follow these steps.

1. Copy the table of data.
1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app first? [install the app and then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

2. Select the **Create** tab.
3. Select **Paste or manually enter data**.

4. Select the first cell and paste the data.
1. Select **Use first row as headers** if appropriate, give the table a name, then select **Auto-create report**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-paste-auto-create.png" alt-text="Select Auto-create report.":::

1. Set a sensitivity label, if prompted.

    Power BI automatically analyzes and visualizes your data in a pre-built report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-auto-created-report.png" alt-text="Power BI automatically analyzes and visualize your data.":::

1. Select **Personalize this visual** to customize a single visual.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-auto-created-report-personalize-visual.png" alt-text="Personalize this visual.":::

1. **Save** the report.
1. Select **More options (...)** > **Edit** to customize the whole report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-edit-auto-created-report.png" alt-text="Select Edit to customize the whole report.":::

When you’re done, save and share the report with your colleagues in Teams.

## Create a report from a dataset in your organization

Many organizations share datasets that you can use to build your reports. These datasets are great because they offer up-to-date authoritative data. Datasets that are marked *certified* or *promoted* are likely to be higher quality and better maintained, so your reports will keep working longer.

To build a report from a dataset shared with you, follow these steps.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.
2. Select the **Create** tab > **Pick a published dataset**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-create-published-dataset.png" alt-text="Pick a published dataset.":::

4. Select a dataset > **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-select-dataset.png" alt-text="Select a dataset and Create.":::

6. Start exploring the data. 

    - Use visualizations like charts, tables, and maps to show data in various ways. 
    - Select data points to see other visuals update to filter data to your selection. Change formatting to make the report useful and readable by your colleagues. 

1. When you’re done, save and then share the report.

## Explore datasets and reports shared with you

It's easy to find all the datasets your organization has shared with you. They’re in the Datasets hub in the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams. Again, datasets that are marked *certified* or *promoted* are likely to be higher quality and better maintained.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app first? [install the app and then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

2. Go to the **Datasets** tab.
3. Select a dataset from the list or from recommended datasets.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-datasets-tab.png" alt-text="Select a dataset from the list or from recommended datasets.":::

4. Explore the **Dataset details** page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-datasets-details.png" alt-text="Explore the Dataset details page.":::

    - Discover pre-built reports that use the dataset.
    - Create a report in Power BI from the dataset with **Create from scratch**.
    - Create an Excel workbook connected to the dataset with Analyze in Excel.

When you find interesting reports that are relevant to your team, bring them into your collaboration by adding them to channels, meetings, and chats as tabs or in a conversation.

## Enhance reports in the Power BI service and in Teams

It’s easy to keep working on your reports, right in the Power BI service and in Power BI in Teams. Take advantage of the artificial intelligence capabilities built into Power BI. 

### Q&A visual

For example, ask a question of your data by adding a *Q&A visual*, where you can ask natural language questions and get answers in the form of a visual.

1. In the Visualizations pane, select the **Q&A** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-qna-visual-icon.png" alt-text="Select the Q&A visual icon.":::

    Power BI generates a list of suggested questions you can choose from, or type your own.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-qna-visual.png" alt-text="Q&A visual with list of suggested questions.":::

1. If you like the visual that Power BI created, you can convert it from a Q&A visual to a standard visual on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-pin-qna-visual.png" alt-text="Convert it from a Q&A visual to a standard visual on the page.":::

Read more about [creating Q&A visuals](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-q-and-a.md).

### Smart narrative visual

You can also easily create a *smart narrative* visual, a dynamically generated text box that provides relevant insights that you can customize.

1. In the Visualizations pane, select the **Smart narrative** visual icon.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-smart-narrative-visual-icon.png" alt-text="Select the Smart narrative visual icon.":::

    Power BI generates a text description of key takeaways in your report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-smart-narrative-visual.png" alt-text="Power BI generates a text description of key takeaways in your report.":::

1. You can edit the visual, changing the way it looks and also the inline values it generates.

Here's a tutorial about [creating smart narrative visuals](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-smart-narrative.md).

## Create sophisticated reports in Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop is a downloadable Windows app you can use to make more sophisticated reports. It's like PowerPoint, but it uses data visualizations to help you find insights in your data. Power BI Desktop also has powerful capabilities like data import, cleaning, modeling, and much more.

To get started with Power BI Desktop, follow these steps.

1. To install Power BI Desktop, this link takes you directly to the [Power BI Desktop page](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore) of the Microsoft Store.
1. Create a report in Power BI Desktop. In this sample tutorial, you prepare and model your data, both tasks you can't do in a report in the Power BI service. Then you create a report based on the model you've created.

    [From dimensional model to stunning report in Power BI Desktop](../create-reports/desktop-dimensional-model-report.md)

1. [Publish the report](../collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web.md) to the Power BI service.
1. Share the report with your colleagues in Teams.
