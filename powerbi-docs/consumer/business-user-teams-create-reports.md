# Customer intent: As a Power BI customer or potential customer, I want to get a definition of a Power BI consumer so I know if I am a consumer (versus designer, admin, creator, or dev) and, as a consumer, what I can accomplish with the Power BI service.

## Create a report from a dataset shared in your organization

Many organizations share dataset that you can use to build your reports. These are great since you can get up to date authoritative data. If you have certified or promoted datasets, they’re likely to be higher quality and maintained so your reports will keep working more often.

To build a report from a dataset shared to you, follow these steps.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.
2. Select the **Create** tab > **Pick a published dataset**.

    :::image type="content" source="../collaborate-share/media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-create-published-dataset.png" alt-text="Pick a published dataset.":::

4. Select a dataset > **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="../collaborate-share/media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-select-dataset.png" alt-text="Select a dataset and Create.":::

6. Start exploring your data.

Use visualizations like charts, tables, and maps to show data in various ways. Click on data points to see other visuals update to filter data to your selection. Change formatting to make the report useful and readable by your colleagues. When you’re done just save and then share the report.

## Discover datasets and reports your organization has shared with you

It's easy to find all the datasets your organization has shared with you. They’re in the Datasets hub in the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

To start exploring the datasets shared with you, follow these steps.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app first? [install the app and then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

2. Go to the **Datasets** tab.
3. Select a dataset from the list or from recommended datasets.

    - Discover pre-built reports that use the dataset.
    - Create a report in Power BI from the dataset with Create from scratch.

When you find interesting reports that are relevant to your team, bring then into your collaboration by adding them to channels, meetings, and chats as tabs or in a conversation.

## Create even more reports

It’s easy to make stunning, interactive reports using Power BI Desktop, which is like PowerPoint, but it uses data visualizations to help you find insights in your data. Power BI Desktop runs on Windows and has additional capabilities like data import, cleaning, modeling, and much more.
