# Create reports from data in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

It’s easy to create Power BI reports in Microsoft Teams. This article has a few examples of reports you can create. When you’re ready, you can also use tools like Power BI Desktop for more advanced report authoring.

## Create an automatic report from data you have

If you have a table with data, such as an Excel spreadsheet, and want to try visualizing in Power BI, follow these steps to create your report.

1. Copy the table of data.
1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app? [Install the app, then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

1. Select the **Create** tab.
1. Select **Paste or manually enter data**.

1. Select the first cell and paste the data.
1. Select **Use first row as headers** if appropriate, give the table a name, then select **Auto-create report**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-paste-auto-create.png" alt-text="Select Auto-create report.":::

1. Set a sensitivity label, if prompted.

    Power BI automatically analyzes and visualizes your data in a pre-built report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-auto-created-report.png" alt-text="Power BI automatically analyzes and visualize your data.":::

1. Select **Personalize this visual** to customize a single visual.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-auto-created-report-personalize-visual.png" alt-text="Personalize this visual.":::

1. **Save** the report.
1. Select **More options (...)** > **Edit** to customize the whole report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-edit-auto-created-report.png" alt-text="Select Edit to customize the whole report.":::

When you’re done, save and share the report with your colleagues in Teams.

## Create a report from a dataset in your organization

Many organizations share datasets that you can use to build your reports. These datasets are great because they offer up-to-date authoritative data. Datasets marked *certified* or *promoted* are likely to be higher quality and better maintained, so your reports keep working longer.

To build a report from a dataset shared with you, follow these steps.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.
1. Select the **Create** tab > **Pick a published dataset**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-create-published-dataset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Power BI app open in Teams with the Create tab and Pick a published dataset option highlighted.":::

1. Select a dataset > **Auto-create report**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-select-dataset.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a window open to select a dataset to create a report with the report and create button highlighted.":::

1. Start exploring the data.

    - Use visualizations like charts, tables, and maps to show data in various ways.
    - Select data points to see other visuals update to filter data to your selection. Change formatting to make the report useful and readable by your colleagues.

1. After you complete your work, save and share the report.

## Explore datasets and reports shared with you

It's easy to find all the datasets your organization has shared with you. They’re in the Datasets hub in the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams. Again, datasets marked *certified* or *promoted* are likely to be higher quality and better maintained.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app? [Install the app, then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

1. Go to the **Data hub** tab.
1. Select a dataset from the list or from the recommended datasets.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-datasets-tab.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Data hHub tab selected with the recommended datasets and a list of datasets.":::

1. Explore the **Dataset details** page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-datasets-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Dataset details page and related reports.":::

    - Discover pre-built reports that use the dataset.
    - Create a report in Power BI from the dataset with **Create a report**.
    - Share data and give people access to the dataset to work.
    - Select a table or column to export data or select more than one table to create a paginated report.

When you find interesting reports relevant to your team, bring them into your collaboration. Add them to channels, meetings, and chats as tabs or in a conversation.

## Enhance reports in the Power BI service and in Teams

It’s easy to keep working on your reports right in the Power BI service and Power BI in Teams. Take advantage of the artificial intelligence capabilities built into Power BI.

### Q&A visual

For example, ask a question about your data by adding a *Q&A visual*, where you can ask natural language questions and get answers in the form of a visual.

1. In the Visualizations pane, select the **Q&A** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-qna-visual-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visualization pane with Q&A visual icon selected.":::

    Power BI generates a list of suggested questions you can choose from or type your own.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-qna-visual.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Visualization pane with the Q&A visual selected and a list of suggested questions.":::

1. If you like the visual that Power BI creates, you can convert it from a Q&A visual to a standard visual on the page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-pin-qna-visual.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Q&A result with the Convert Q&A visual icon highlighted.":::

For more information, see [Create a Q&A visual in a report in Power BI](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-q-and-a.md).

### Smart narrative visual

You can also easily create a *smart narrative* visual, a dynamically generated text box that provides relevant insights that you can customize.

1. In the Visualizations pane, select the **Smart narrative** visual icon.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-smart-narrative-visual-icon.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a Visualization pane with the Smart narrative visual icon selected.":::

    Power BI generates a text description of key takeaways in your report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/power-bi-teams-smart-narrative-visual.png" alt-text="Screenshot of visuals and the text description dialog box generated with the Smart narrative.":::

1. You can edit the visual, change the way it looks, and change the inline values it generates.

For more information, see [Create smart narrative summaries](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-smart-narrative.md).

## Create sophisticated reports in Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop is a downloadable Windows app to make sophisticated reports. It's like PowerPoint, but it uses data visualizations to help you gain insights into your data. Power BI Desktop has powerful capabilities like data import, cleaning, modeling, and much more.

To get started with Power BI Desktop, follow these steps.

1. Install Power BI Desktop. You can download it from the [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore).

   > [!div class="nextstepaction"]
   > [Get Power BI Desktop](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore)

1. Create a report in Power BI Desktop.</br>In the following tutorial sample, you prepare and model your data. Then create a report based on the model you've created. You can't do both tasks in a report in the Power BI service.

    [Tutorial: From dimensional model to stunning report in Power BI Desktop](../create-reports/desktop-dimensional-model-report.md)

1. [Publish the report](../collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web.md) to the Power BI service.
1. Share the report with your colleagues in Teams.
