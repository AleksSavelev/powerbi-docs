# Create reports from data in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

It’s easy to create Power BI reports with just a few clicks in Microsoft Teams. This article gives a few examples of those quick reports you can create. When you’re ready you can also use tools like Power BI Desktop for more advanced report authoring.

## Create an automatic report from data you have

Say you have a table with data that you'd like to try visualizing in Power BI, maybe from Excel. To create your first report, follow these steps.

1. Copy the table of data.
1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app first? [install the app and then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

2. Select the **Create** tab.
3. Select **Paste or manually enter data**.

4. Select the first cell and paste the data.
1. Select **Use first row as headers** if appropriate, give the table a name, then select **Auto-create report**.

1. Set a sensitivity label, if prompted.

    Power BI automatically analyzes and visualizes your data in a pre-built report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-auto-created-report.png" alt-text="Power BI automatically analyzes and visualize your data.":::

1. Select **Personalize this visual** to customize a single visual.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-auto-created-report-personalize-visual.png" alt-text="Personalize this visual.":::

1. **Save** the report.
1. Select **More options (...)** > **Edit** to customize the whole report.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-edit-auto-created-report.png" alt-text="Select Edit to customize the whole report.":::

When you’re done, save and share the report with your colleagues in Teams.

## Create a report from a dataset shared in your organization

Many organizations share datasets that you can use to build your reports. These datasets are great because they offer up-to-date authoritative data. Datasets that are marked *certified* or *promoted* are likely to be higher quality and better maintained, so your reports will keep working longer.

To build a report from a dataset shared with you, follow these steps.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.
2. Select the **Create** tab > **Pick a published dataset**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-create-published-dataset.png" alt-text="Pick a published dataset.":::

4. Select a dataset > **Create**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-select-dataset.png" alt-text="Select a dataset and Create.":::

6. Start exploring the data. 

    - Use visualizations like charts, tables, and maps to show data in various ways. 
    - Select data points to see other visuals update to filter data to your selection. Change formatting to make the report useful and readable by your colleagues. 

1. When you’re done, save and then share the report.

## Discover datasets and reports your organization has shared with you

It's easy to find all the datasets your organization has shared with you. They’re in the Datasets hub in the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

To start exploring the datasets shared with you, follow these steps.

1. Open the Power BI app for Microsoft Teams.

    Need to install the Power BI app first? [install the app and then pin it](../collaborate-share/service-microsoft-teams-app.md#install-the-power-bi-app) to the Teams navigation pane.

2. Go to the **Datasets** tab.
3. Select a dataset from the list or from recommended datasets.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-datasets-tab.png" alt-text="Select a dataset from the list or from recommended datasets.":::

4. Explore the Dataset details page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-create-reports/teams-power-bi-datasets-details.png" alt-text="Explore the Dataset details page.":::

    - Discover pre-built reports that use the dataset.
    - Create a report in Power BI from the dataset with Create from scratch.
    - Create an Excel workbook connected to the dataset with Analyze in Excel.

When you find interesting reports that are relevant to your team, bring then into your collaboration by adding them to channels, meetings, and chats as tabs or in a conversation.

## Create more sophisticated reports

It’s easy to make stunning, interactive reports using Power BI Desktop. It's like PowerPoint, but it uses data visualizations to help you find insights in your data. Power BI Desktop runs on Windows and has additional capabilities like data import, cleaning, modeling, and much more. 

To get started with Power BI Desktop, follow these steps.

1. To install Power BI Desktop, open a browser and go directly to the [Power BI Desktop page](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopstore) of the Microsoft Store.
1. Create a report in Power BI Desktop. Here's a sample you can create:

    [From Excel workbook to stunning report in Power BI Desktop](../create-reports/desktop-excel-stunning-report.md)

1. [Publish the report](../collaborate-share/service-publish-to-web.md) to the Power BI service.
1. Share the report with your colleagues in Teams.
