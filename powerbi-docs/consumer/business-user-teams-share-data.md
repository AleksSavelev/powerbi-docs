# Customer intent: As a Power BI customer or potential customer, I want to get a definition of a Power BI consumer so I know if I am a consumer (versus designer, admin, creator, or dev) and, as a consumer, what I can accomplish with the Power BI service.

Data helps everyone get on the same page before important decisions. Sharing data with your team is important and easy with Power BI in Microsoft Teams. Follow these steps
Share with your channels, chats, and meeting

1. Open the place you’d like to share into
2. Add the Power BI tab
3. Pick the item you’d like to share
4. Press save
This works in channels, meetings, and even in chats. Make sure you give permission to your teams. Don’t worry, they can also request access later.
Chat about data with rich links and cards
When discussing data, it’s important that your colleagues can open the underlying data to see and explore trends. This helps them answer questions and to understand the full context of requests you’re making. It’s also an easy way to encourage more use of data in decision making. 
Discussing data is easy, just follow these steps:

1. Open a report in Power BI 
2. (Optionally) select a specific data visualization
3. Press the Chat in Teams button 
4. Send a message to a channel where you work with your team

The link will include the full context of what data you were looking at, including the page, visual, any filters applied. When your colleague open the link, they’ll quickly see the data you’re referring to.

Quickly send links to reports your colleagues need

1. In the Teams channel or chat, start a new conversation
2. In the command bar for the editor, select “…” and pick or search for Power BI 
3. Pick or search for the content you want to share
4. Press send
A rich card is added to the conversation making it easy to open the item. It’s a great way to help without leaving the conversation, which save you time.

Automatic rich cards from links you paste in chat
If you use Power BI in a web browser, it’s easy to send link to a colleague. 

1. Copy the link from the browser
2. Start a conversation and paste the link
3. A rich card is automatically created
4. Press send
