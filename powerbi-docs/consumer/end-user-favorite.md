# Favorite dashboards, reports, and apps in the Power BI service

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

When you make content a *favorite*, you can access it quickly from the **Favorites** content list. Favorites are typically content that you visit most often and are identified with a filled star.

## Add a dashboard or report as a favorite

1. Open a dashboard or report that you use often. Even content that has been shared with you can be a favorite.

2. From the upper menu bar of the Power BI service, select **Favorite** or the star ![Star icon](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorite-icon.png) icon.

   You can also favorite a dashboard or report from anywhere you see the star icon, such as Home, Recent, Apps, and Shared with me.

## Work with favorites
You have several options for viewing your favorites. 

1. To see all the content that you've added as favorites, in the nav pane, select **Favorites** or the Favorites ![Screenshot showing all current favorites.](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorites-icon.png) icon. 
   
    ![Favorites window](./media/end-user-favorite/power-bi-favorites-screen.png)
   
   From here, you can take action. You can open a favorite, identify owners, and even share favorites with your colleagues.

1. To access your most visited favorites, select the flyout arrow to the right of **Favorites**. From here, you can select a favorite to open it. Up to five favorites are listed alphabetically. If you have more than five, select **See all** to open the favorites content list.

1. Favorites are also available from Power BI Home.  If you've selected the **Expanded** display mode, your favorites are listed in the **Favorites + frequents** section. If you've selected the **Simplified** display mode, your favorites are listed in the **Favorites** tab.

## Unfavorite content
If you no longer use a report, dashboard, or app as often as you used to, you can unfavorite it. When you unfavorite content, it's removed from your Favorites list but not from Power BI.  Just select the black star to turn it back to a white star.

## Considerations and limitations
- At the current time, you can favorite an app and this automatically favorites all the reports and dashboards for that app. It isn't possible to favorite individual app reports or dashboards. 
- Effective January 2022, Power BI Home will no longer display ***tiles*** from your favorited dashboard.
