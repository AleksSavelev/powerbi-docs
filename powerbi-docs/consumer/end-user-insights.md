# View data insights on dashboard tiles with Power BI

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

Each visual tile on your dashboard is a doorway into data exploration. For more information, see [Dashboard tiles in Power BI](end-user-tiles.md). When you select a tile, it opens a report or Q&A [(Q&A for Power BI Business users)](end-user-q-and-a.md), where you can filter and dig into the dataset behind the report. And when you run insights, Power BI does the data exploration for you.

When you run insights on tiles, Power BI looks at the data used to render that tile. If Power BI finds interesting facts or trends in that data, you'll see those facts or trends in the form of interactive visuals. Insights can run on a specific dashboard tile and you can even run insights on an insight!

The insights feature is built on a growing set of advanced analytical algorithms developed in conjunction with Microsoft Research that allows people to find insights in their data in new and intuitive ways. For more information, see [Types of insights supported by Power BI](end-user-insight-types.md). The dashboard insights feature is similar to the dataset **quick insights** feature. To see how to run quick insights on an entire data set, see [Generate data insights on your dataset automatically with Power BI](../create-reports/service-insights.md).

## Run insights on a dashboard tile
When you run insights on a dashboard tile, Power BI searches just the data used to create that single dashboard tile.

1. Open a dashboard. For more information, see [Dashboards for business users of the Power BI service](end-user-dashboards.md).
2. Hover over a tile, select the **More options** (...) feature on the tile, then choose **View insights** from the dropdown menu.

3. The tile opens in Focus mode with the insights cards displayed along the right. For more information, see [Display content in more detail: focus mode and full screen mode](end-user-focus.md).

4. After you decide which insight card to explore, select it. You'll see the selected insight appear on the left, and new insight cards, based solely on the data in that single insight, display along the right.

## Interact with the insight cards

Now that you have an insight open, you can continue exploring.

   * Filter the visual on the canvas.  To see the filters, go to the filter's pane and select the arrow in the upper right corner.

   * You can run insights on the insight card itself. This is often referred to as **related insights**. To do this, select an insight card to make it active. It will move to the left side of the report canvas, and new cards, based solely on the data in that single insight, will  display along the right.

To return to your report, select **Exit Focus mode**, located in the upper left corner of the screen.

## Considerations and troubleshooting
- **View insights** doesn't work with all dashboard tile types. For example, it isn't available for Power BI custom visuals, streaming data, DirectQuery tiles, or data protected with RLS (row-level security).<!--[Power BI visuals](end-user-custom-visuals.md)-->
