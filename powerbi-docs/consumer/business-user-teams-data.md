# Use data to make better meetings in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

Keeping everyone on track towards shared objectives and what matters is easier when you use data, trends, and metrics to show the impact of the work you and your team are doing.

It’s easy to use Power BI in meetings to help keep important data top of mind. It helps everyone know which data is the most important, and builds skills that help your team make agile decisions based on your progress towards objectives. By staying focused on driving towards measurable outcomes, your team gains a sense of the positive impact their work is having.

Here's how you can use data before, during, and after your meetings.

- **Before the meeting**, add the reports and scorecards directly to the meeting invite so everyone has access to them. 
- **During the meeting**, open and present these from the calendar. You can even use chat to share more reports and scorecards, or to quickly find the right data to answer questions raised in the meeting. 
- **After the meeting**, send a summary with key results that were discussed and actions the team decided to take to help achieve the desired outcomes.

## Data-driven questions to ask

Here are some questions you can use in your meeting agenda to jump start discussion and determine the best actions to take to achieve your desired outcomes:

- Are we making progress toward our object as quickly as we expected to?
- What actions can we take in the next week or month that are most likely to move these numbers?
- What numbers can we start tracking to get a better sense of if we’re making progress towards our desired outcomes?

Review your data weekly, or at least monthly, to get in the habit of asking questions, discussing the best actions to take in the next week or two, and helping the team learn to leverage the data as they plan their work.

## Add Power BI to a meeting

Here's how to add a Power BI report or scorecard to a meeting.

1. Create the meeting and invite others.
2. Send the meeting invite.
3. Select **Edit** to open the meeting in the calendar. You only see the option to edit if you're the meeting organizer.

1. Select **Save** to finish adding the report or scorecard to the meeting.

## Before the meeting

It's a good idea to review your data in Power BI before a meeting.

1. Open the meeting from the calendar.
2. Open the Power BI tab that has the report or scorecard.
3. Review the report or scorecard.

Consider setting a reminder for your meeting so attendees can also pre-read the data before the meeting. This helps everyone be up with the latest data, and improves the discussion during the meeting.

## During the meeting

When you’re in a meeting, data can help guide the discussion or answer questions raised by attendees. It’s easy to present data in Power BI during the meeting, share links to data with meeting attendees, and even find data that can answer questions.

1. After joining the meeting, navigate to the Teams window.
2. Open the calendar in Teams.
3. Select **Edit** to open the meeting in the calendar.

5. Use the meeting window to present your screen.
