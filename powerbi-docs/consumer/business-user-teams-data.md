# Use data to make better meetings in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

Keeping everyone on track towards your shared objectives and what matters is easier when you use data, trends, and metrics to show the impact of the work you and your team are doing. 
It’s easy to use Power BI in meetings to help keep important data top of mind. It’s important because it helps everyone know which data is the most important, and it builds skills that help your team make agile decisions based on your progress towards objectives. By staying focused on driving towards measurable outcomes, your team can gain a sense of the positive impact the work they do is making.
Before the meeting, you can add the reports and scorecards directly to the meeting invite so everyone has access to them. During the meeting you can open and present these from the calendar. You can even use chat to share more reports and scorecards, or to quickly find the right data to answer questions raised in the meeting. After the meeting send a summary with key results that were discussed and actions the team decided to take to help achieve the desired outcomes.
Here are some questions you can use in your meeting agenda to jump start discussion and determine the best actions to take to achieve your desired outcomes:
• Are we making progress toward our object as quickly as we expected to?
• What actions can we take in the next week/month that are most likely to move these numbers?
• What numbers can we start tracking to get a better sense of if we’re making progress towards our desired outcomes?
It’s best to review data at least monthly (ideally weekly) to get in the habit of asking questions, discussing the best actions to take in the next week or two, and helping the team learn to leverage the data as they plan their work.

## Add Power BI to a meeting

To add a Power BI report or scorecard (goals) to a meeting, do the following steps.

1. Create the meeting and invite others
2. Send the meeting invite
3. Open the meeting from the calendar
4. Use the “+” button to add the Power BI tab to the meeting
5. Select a report or goal 
6. Use link to provide everyone with permission to view the report
a. If you can’t give permission, don’t worry other can request access when they try to view the report
7. Press Add to finish adding the report or goal to the meeting.
8. Add an agenda item to the meeting to review and discuss the data

## Review data in Power BI before a meeting

To review data in Power BI before a meeting, do the following steps:

1. Open the meeting from the calendar
2. Open the Power BI tab that has the report or scorecard
3. Review the report or scorecard 
It’s helpful to set a reminder for your meeting so attendees can ‘pre-read’ the data before the meeting. This helps everyone be with the latest data and improves the discussion during the meeting.

## During the meeting

When you’re in a meeting, data can help guide the discussion or answer questions raised by attendees. It’s easy to present data in Power BI during the meeting, share links to data with meeting attendees, or even find data that can answer questions.
To show Power BI in your meeting, do the following steps:

1. After joining the meeting, navigate to the Teams window
2. Open the calendar in Teams
3. Open the meeting 
4. Navigate to the Power BI tab in the meeting
5. Use the meeting window to present your screen

To capture specific visuals and data that are the most important for everyone to see:

1. View the report in Power BI
2. Select the visual 
3. Use the copy visual icon to copy the visual
4. Paste the visual into the meeting chat

To share a link to Power BI reports or scorecards

6. View the report or scorecard in Power BI
7. Press the share button
8. Copy the link 
9. Paste the link to the meeting chat

To find data that could answer questions

1. Open the meeting chat
2. Press the “…” icon
3. Select “… messaging extensions” 
4. Pick Power BI
5. Search for content, or pick from your recents list
6. Pick an item
7. Press send 

## After the meeting
It’s useful to share a summary of the most important data points discussed and the actions the team will take to help achieve outcomes. If you captured visuals during the meeting in chat, you can pull those into a meeting summary post in chat or a follow up message.
