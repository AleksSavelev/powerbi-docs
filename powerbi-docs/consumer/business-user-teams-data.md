# Use data to make productive meetings in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-ynny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-ynny.md)]

Keeping everyone on track towards shared objectives and what matters is easier when you use data, trends, and metrics to show the impact of the work you and your team are doing.

It’s easy to use Power BI in meetings to help keep important data top of mind. It helps everyone know which data is the most important, and builds skills that help your team make agile decisions based on your progress towards objectives. By staying focused on driving towards measurable outcomes, your team gains a sense of the positive impact their work is having.

:::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-power-bi-meeting-tab.png" alt-text="Power BI report in a Teams meeting tab.":::

Here's how you can use data before, during, and after your meetings.

- **[Before the meeting](#before-the-meeting)**, add the reports and scorecards directly to the meeting invite so everyone has access to them. 
- **[During the meeting](#during-the-meeting)**, open and present these reports from the calendar. You can even use chat to share more reports and scorecards, or to quickly find the right data to answer questions raised in the meeting. 
- **[After the meeting](#after-the-meeting)**, send a summary with key results that you discussed and actions the team decided to take to help achieve the desired outcomes.

## Data-driven questions to ask

Here are the kinds of questions you can add to your meeting agenda, to jump start discussion and determine the best actions to take to achieve your desired outcomes:

- **Are we making progress** toward our objectives as quickly as we expected to?
- **What actions can we take** in the next week or month that are most likely to improve our metrics?
- **What metrics can we start tracking** to get a better sense of if we’re making progress towards our desired outcomes?

Review your data weekly, or at least monthly, to get in the habit of asking questions, discussing the best actions to take in the next week or two, and helping the team learn to leverage data as they plan their work.

## Before the meeting

To get ready for the meeting, add a Power BI report or scorecard to the meeting invite. You review the data in the report or scorecard, and encourage other participants to do the same. Then everyone is ready for the meeting.

### Add Power BI

Here's how to add a Power BI report or scorecard to a meeting.

1. Create the meeting and invite others.
2. Send the meeting invite.
3. Select **Edit** to open the meeting in the calendar. You only see the option to edit if you're the meeting organizer.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-calendar-edit.png" alt-text="Edit the calendar item.":::

4. Select the **+ Add a tab** button to add the Power BI tab to the meeting.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-invite-plus-sign.png" alt-text="Select the plus sign + to add a tab.":::

5. Navigate to a report or scorecard and select it.
1. You may need to share it with meeting attendees. Select **Make sure this team has been given access to this report in Power BI**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-power-bi-report-tab.png" alt-text="Make sure this team has been given access to this report in Power BI.":::

    If you didn't select that link, don't worry. Just open the report in Power BI in Teams or in the Power BI service.

1. With the report open in Power BI in Teams, or in the Power BI service, select **File** > **Manage Permissions**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/power-bi-teams-file-manage-permissions.png" alt-text="Select File > Manage permissions to add names.":::

    If you don't see this option, you may not have permission to share the report. If not, again, don’t worry. The attendees can request access themselves when they try to view the report.

1. Select **Direct access**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/power-bi-teams-direct-access.png" alt-text="Select the Direct access option.":::

1. Select **Add user**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/power-bi-teams-add-user.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting Add user.":::

1. Add the names of the meeting attendees. Decide what permissions you want them to have, whether to send them an email, and select **Grant access**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/power-bi-teams-grant-access.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Grant people access dialog.":::

1. Back in Teams, select **Save** to finish adding the report or scorecard to the meeting as a tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-power-bi-save-tab.png" alt-text="Select Save to add this report or scorecard to the meeting tab.":::

1. Add an agenda item to the meeting to review and discuss the data.

### Review the data

It's a good idea to review your data in Power BI before a meeting.

1. Open the meeting from the calendar.
2. Open the Power BI tab that has the report or scorecard.
3. Review the report or scorecard.

Consider setting a reminder for your meeting so attendees can also pre-read the data before the meeting. This helps everyone be aware of the latest data, and improves the discussion during the meeting.

## During the meeting

When you’re in a meeting, data can help guide the discussion or answer questions raised by attendees. It’s easy to present data in Power BI during the meeting, share links to data with meeting attendees, and find data that can answer questions.

1. After joining the meeting, navigate to the Teams window.
2. Open the calendar in Teams.
3. Open the meeting in the calendar.
4. Navigate to the Power BI tab you added to the meeting.
5. Use the meeting window to present your screen.

### Capture specific visuals that are important for everyone to see

1. View the report in the Power BI app in Teams.
2. Select a visual.
3. Select **Copy visual as image** to copy the visual.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-power-bi-copy-visual.png" alt-text="Select Copy visual as image.":::

4. Paste the visual into the meeting chat.

### Quickly send a message in the meeting chat from a report

1. View the report in the Power BI app in Teams or in the Power BI service.
2. Select the report or a specific visual.
3. Select the **Chat in Teams** button.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/power-bi-teams-chat-teams.png" alt-text="Screenshot of select the Chat in Teams icon in a report.":::

4. Select the meeting name to send to.
5. Type your message above the link that's provided.
6. Press **Send**. 

Your message appears as part of the meeting chat. Attendees can open it to see the data you wanted with the filters and slicers applied.

### Answer questions with data in chat

1. Open the meeting chat.
2. Select **Messaging extensions (...)**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-chat-meeting-messaging-extensions.png" alt-text="Select Messaging extensions (...).":::

4. Select **Power BI**.
5. Search for content, or select from your list of recent items.
6. Pick a Power BI item.
7. Select **Send**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-power-bi-meeting-chat-send.png" alt-text="Select Send to send the message in chat.":::

1. Select **Open**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/business-user-teams-data/teams-power-bi-meeting-chat-open.png" alt-text="Select Open to open the message in chat.":::

## After the meeting

It’s useful to share a summary of the most important data points discussed and the actions the team will take to help achieve outcomes. If you captured visuals during the meeting in chat, you can pull those into a meeting summary post in chat or a follow-up message.

Consider using key data points to create goals and track them in a scorecard. Consistently tracking progress against with a goal through a series of meetings is a great way to keep your team or project on track.
