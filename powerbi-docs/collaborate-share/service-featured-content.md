# Feature content on colleagues' Power BI Home page

[!INCLUDE [applies-to](../includes/applies-to.md)] [!INCLUDE [yes-service](../includes/yes-service.md)] [!INCLUDE [no-desktop](../includes/no-desktop.md)]

You can feature dashboards, reports, and apps so they appear in the Featured section of your colleagues' Power BI Home page. Featuring content is especially useful for onboarding new employees to Power BI. You decide which content they see first. Add descriptions and small thumbnail images to help them find what they need. The content has to be in a new workspace.

## Who can feature content

To feature dashboards and reports, you need to have the Admin, Member, or Contributor role in a workspace. To feature the app itself, you need to have the Admin or Member role in a workspace. See [Roles in the new workspaces](service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) for details. You do need to have a Power BI Pro license. 

Your Power BI admin can turn off the ability to feature content on your tenant, and choose who can feature content. See the [admin portal](../admin/service-admin-portal.md#featured-content) article for details.

## Who sees featured content

When you feature a dashboard or report from a workspace, people with at least a Viewer role in that workspace will see it featured. You can also feature a dashboard or report from an app, or the app itself. In that case, the people you distribute the app to will see it featured.

## Feature a dashboard or report

The procedure for featuring either a dashboard or report is similar.

1. In the **All** or **Content** list for a workspace, select **More options (...)** > **Settings**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-featured-content/power-bi-settings-icon.png" alt-text="Report Settings icon":::

2. In the **Settings** pane, check or change the name. Add a **Description** and upload a **Snapshot**, if you want them. They're useful because they help your users find your content.

3. Select **Feature on Home**.

4. Select **Save**.

    Now all users who have access to this dashboard or report will see it in the **Featured** section on **Home**.

## Feature an app

- To feature an app, open the workspace for the app, select the **Options** menu (**...**) > **Feature this app on Home**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-featured-content/power-bi-feature-app-home.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Feature this app on Home.":::

Now everyone who has access to this app will also see it in the **Featured** section on **Home**.

## Considerations

Endorsing an app or a report by promoting it automatically checks the **Feature on Home** checkbox. You can uncheck **Feature on Home** anytime. If you do, changing endorsement doesn't recheck **Feature on Home**. Read more about [promoting your content](service-endorse-content.md#promote-content).
