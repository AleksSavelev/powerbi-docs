# Get notified about important activity from Power BI in Microsoft Teams

This article describes how you can be notified of important activity from Power BI in Microsoft Teams. The **Teams activity feed** collects all these notifications so they're easy to find. By using Power BI notifications in Microsoft Teams, you can collaborate faster because important activity arrives right where you already work.

To receive notifications in Teams you’ll need to install the Power BI app for Teams. You’ll start getting notified when important things happen, including:
- Someone shared a report to you and sends a message about it through Power BI.
- Someone requests access to a report you own or manage. 

## Using Power BI notifications in the Teams activity feed

Here are a few things to know about the **notifications in the Teams activity feed** :

- To receive notifications in Teams, you need to install the [Power BI app for Teams](service-microsoft-teams-app.md).
- When you open a notification, it opens directly in Microsoft Teams.
- You can use Teams settings to control how you receive notifications sent by Power BI.
- Sharing and request access notifications only work for content in workspaces, not in Power BI organizational apps.
- Notifications don't work in Teams mobile.
- Notifications are only sent to individuals, not to user groups.
- A Power BI admin can turn off the notifications through the **Microsoft Teams integration in the Power BI service** tenant setting.

## Notifications sent by Power BI in the Teams activity feed

### Report Sharing

When someone shares a report to you, a notification appears as a banner and in the Teams activity feed by default.

:::image type="content" source="media/service-teams-pivot/power-bi-app-home-in-teams-tab.png" alt-text="View all the tabs you use in Microsoft Teams.":::

The report opens directly within the activity feed experience. 
You can press the **Open in Power BI** button to open the report in the Power BI app for Teams. When you do, you can pop-out the report by right-clicking the Power BI icon in the Teams left navigation. This is helpful when multi-tasking.
You can customize how to receive these notifications through the **Actions and updates** setting.

### Report request access

When someone requests access to a report you'll get a notification in Teams if you're a report owner or in the report's contact list.

When you open the notification, the grant access experience opens directly within the activity feed experience making it easier to quickly act to help other access the data they need.
When you grant access to a report, a **report sharing** notification is sent to users in Teams and in e-mail.
You can customize how to receive these notifications through the **Actions and updates** setting.

## Customizing how you receive Power BI notifications
In Microsoft Teams settings, you can customize how you receive notifications sent by Power BI. You can pick if you receive them as a banner, in the feed, or not at all.

The currently supported notifications are in the **Actions and updates** category. The remaining categories are reserved for future use and don't currently control any notifications. 

## Admin control over notifications 

Generally, we recommend Power BI admins to allow notifications in Teams. However, the [**Microsoft Teams integration in the Power BI service**](../admin/service-admin-portal#microsoft-teams-integration-in-the-power-bi-service) Power BI tenant setting can be used to stop sending all notifications to users in the organization. This overrides any user preferences so if you’re not receiving notifications in Teams, contact your Power BI admin.
Additionally, since receiving notifications in Teams can help speed up collaboration in your organization, Power BI admins can work with their Teams Admins to install Power BI broadly in the organization through an app setup policy.
