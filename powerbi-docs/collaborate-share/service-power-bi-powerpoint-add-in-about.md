# About Power BI in PowerPoint

The Power BI add-in for PowerPoint enables you to add live, interactive data from Power BI to your PowerPoint presentations. This means not only that the data shown in your PowerPoint presentation will always be up to date, but also that while you're presenting, you'll be able to filter and drill down on data in response to questions and feedback from your audience without having to switch contexts.

Currently, the add-in supports adding report pages to PowerPoint slides individually. The left-hand page navigation pane isn't brought in by the add-in, but any page navigation visuals on the report page itself will function normally as they do in the Power BI service.

You can add report pages to PowerPoint presentations starting from either PowerPoint or Power BI. For Power BI to be used as the starting point, Power BI storytelling functionality must be [enabled in your organization](../admin/service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#enable-power-bi-add-in-for-powerpoint).

## Requirements

To use the Power BI add-in for PowerPoint, you must have access to the Office add-in store, or the add-in must be available to you as an [admin managed add-in](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).

To be able to view live Power BI data in PowerPoint, you must have an active Power BI account and a Power BI Free license, as well as access to the data. If the Power BI report isn't located in a Premium capacity, a Power BI Pro license is needed.

## Security

Power BI data added to PowerPoint using the Power BI add-in remains in Power BI. No data is actually exported from Power BI. As such, the data respects all Power BI permissions and data security, including [row-level security (RLS)](../enterprise/service-admin-rls.md), so your data remains secure.

## Information for the Power BI administrator

If you're a Power BI administrator, see [Information for Power BI administrators](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-admin.md) for further details about the add-in.
