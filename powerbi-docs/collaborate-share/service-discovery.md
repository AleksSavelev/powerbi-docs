# Discoverability

Discoverability is a feature that makes it possible for users to find endorsed datasets that they don't have access to. Without discoverability, the full value of [endorsement](service-endorsement-overview.md), that is, directing users to quality data, is not fully realized.

## Discoverability overview

Endorsement is a way of telling users that a dataset is a trusted, quality source of data that they can safely use. However, in Power BI, endorsed datasets, like all other datasets, are only visible to those who have access to them. This makes it difficult for people without access to find these trusted sources of data. Not only do they not have access to an endorsed dataset, they don't know it exists, so they can't even request access.

To overcome this problem, users who have an [Admin or Member role](service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) in the workspace where dataset resides can mark that dataset as discoverable when they promote or certify it. After the dataset has been marked as discoverable, it will be listed in the [datasets hub](../connect-data/service-datasets-hub.md), even for users who don't have access to it. They can then request [build permission](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md) on the dataset by whatever [access request mechanism](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md#configure-how-users-request-build-permission) has been provided.

To see how to mark endorsed datasets as discoverable, refer to [Endorse your content](collaborate-share/service-endorse-content.md).

Power BI administrators: To see how to set up discoverability on your tenant, refer to [Discovery settings](../admin/service-admin-portal.md#discovery-settings).
