# Create the new workspaces in Power BI

This article explains how to create one of the *new workspaces* instead of a *classic* workspace. Both kinds of workspaces are places to collaborate with colleagues. In them, you create collections of dashboards, reports, and paginated reports. If you want, you can also bundle that collection into an *app* and distribute it to a broader audience. For more background, see the [new workspaces](service-new-workspaces.md) article.

Ready to migrate your classic workspace? See [Upgrade classic workspaces to the new workspaces in Power BI](service-upgrade-workspaces.md) for details.

## Give access to your workspace

Anyone who has an admin role in a workspace can give others access to the workspace by adding them to the different roles. Workspace creators are automatically admins. See [Roles in the new workspaces](service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) for an explanation of the roles.

> [!NOTE]
> To enforce row-level security (RLS) for Power BI Pro users browsing content in a workspace, assign the users the Viewer Role. See [Roles in the new workspaces](service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) for an explanation of the different roles.

1. Because you're an admin, on the workspace content list page, you see **Access**.

1. Add security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or individuals to these workspaces as admins, members, contributors, or viewers.
