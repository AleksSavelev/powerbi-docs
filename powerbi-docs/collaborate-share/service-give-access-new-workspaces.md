# Give users access to the new workspaces in Power BI

After you [create one of the new workspaces](service-create-the-new-workspaces.md) in Power BI, or if you have an admin role in a workspace, you can give others access to it by adding them to the different roles. you'll want to give users access to it. Workspace creators are automatically admins. See [Roles in the new workspaces](service-roles-new-workspaces.md) for an explanation of the different roles.

> [!NOTE]
> To enforce row-level security (RLS) for Power BI Pro users browsing content in a workspace, assign users the Viewer Role.

## Give access to your workspace

1. Because you have the Admin role in the workspace, on the workspace content list page, you see **Access**.

1. Add security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or individuals to these workspaces as admins, members, contributors, or viewers.
