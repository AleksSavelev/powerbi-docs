# Give users access to workspaces in Power BI

After you [create a workspace](service-create-the-new-workspaces.md) in Power BI, or if you have an admin role in a workspace, you can give others access to it by adding them to the different roles. Workspace creators are automatically admins. See [Roles in workspaces](service-roles-new-workspaces.md) for an explanation of the different roles.

> [!NOTE]
> To enforce row-level security (RLS) for Power BI Pro users who are browsing content in a workspace, assign them the Viewer Role.
> 
> After you add or remove a user or a group for workspace access, the permission change will only take effect the next time the user logs into Power BI.

## Give access to your workspace

1. Because you have the Admin role in the workspace, on the workspace content list page, you see **Access**.

1. Add security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or individuals to these workspaces as admins, members, contributors, or viewers.
