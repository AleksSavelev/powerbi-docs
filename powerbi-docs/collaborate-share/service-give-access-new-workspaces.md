# Give users access to the new workspaces in Power BI

After you [create one of the new workspaces](service-create-the-new-workspaces.md) in Power BI, you'll want to give users access to it. For more background, see the [new workspaces](service-new-workspaces.md) article.

If you have an admin role in a workspace, you can give others access to the workspace by adding them to the different roles. Workspace creators are automatically admins. See [Roles in the new workspaces](service-new-workspaces.md#roles-in-the-new-workspaces) for an explanation of the roles.

> [!NOTE]
> To enforce row-level security (RLS) for Power BI Pro users browsing content in a workspace, assign the users the Viewer Role.

## Give access to your workspace

1. Because you have the Admin role in the workspace, on the workspace content list page, you see **Access**.

1. Add security groups, distribution lists, Microsoft 365 groups, or individuals to these workspaces as admins, members, contributors, or viewers.
