# What's new in the Power BI add-in for PowerPoint

## April 2023

### Customize the look of the add-in with styles!

You can now customize the look of the add-in in your presentations. Currently the **Outline** option allows you to put a border around the add-in to give it a defined, neat appearance.

### Add individual live Power BI visuals to your PowerPoint slides

Ever want to put just a single live visual on a slide? Well, now it's super easy. Just right click on the visual and choose **Open in PowerPoint** to open a new presentation with the visual already loaded into the add-in. If you're adding the visual to an existing presentation, choose **Link to selection** to get the visual's URL for pasting into the add-in in the existing presentation. You can do the same from the **More options (...)** menu. Check out the [documentation](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-install.md#get-the-url-of-a-visual) for details!

### Enhance your presentations with Power BI data insights

Power BI's data insights help you find and explore insights such as anomalies and trends as you consume and interact with your data. Now with the add-in, you can easily generate insights, which you can then either paste directly into your slide or copy to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere, such as in the slide's notes.
