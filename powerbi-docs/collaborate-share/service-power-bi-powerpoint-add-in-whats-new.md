# What's new in the Power BI add-in for PowerPoint

## February 2023

### Add individual live Power BI visuals to your PowerPoint slides

Ever want to put just a single live visual on a slide? Well, now it's super easy. [Check out how!](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-install.md#get-the-url-of-a-visual).

### Enhance your presentations with Power BI data insights

Power BI's data insights help you explore and find insights such as anomalies and trends as you consume and interact with your data. Now with the add-in, you can easily generate insights, which you can then either paste directly into your slide or copy to the clipboard for pasting elsewhere, such as in the slide's notes. [Learn more](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-view-present.md#enrich-your-presentation-with-data-insights).

### National cloud support

The Power BI add-in for PowerPoint is now supported in national clouds as an admin-managed add-in. Admin's should see [Deploying the add-in in national clouds](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-admin.md#deploying-the-add-in-in-national-clouds) for further details.
