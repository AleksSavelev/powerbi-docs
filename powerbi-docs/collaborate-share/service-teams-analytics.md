# Analyze your Teams usage in the Power BI app for Teams

This article describes how you automatically generate a Power BI report to analyze your Microsoft Teams activity, in Teams.

Only you can see this report about your Teams activity, unless you choose to share it. Microsoft Teams also offers a [summary report for Teams admins](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/teams-usage-report). It gives admins an overview of the usage activity in Teams, including the number of active users and channels, guests, and messages in each team.

## Requirements

To view your Teams activity analytics in Microsoft Teams, ensure these elements:

- You have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license.
- Sign in to the Power BI service to activate your Power BI license.
- [Install the Power BI app for Teams](service-microsoft-teams-app.md).

## Create the Teams analytics report

Open the Power BI app in Teams, and select **Create**.
Select **Analyze your Teams data**.

Power BI automatically creates your report, displays it in your Power BI Teams app, and saves it to your **My workspace**. The report is yours. As with any of your reports, you can view it in Teams or in the Power BI service. You can edit it, save a copy of it, or download the .pbix file to edit it in Power BI Desktop.

## Pages in the Teams activity report

The Teams activity analytics report comprises three pages showing different aspects of your activity in Teams.

### My activity page

The **My activity** page shows a summary of your recent activity in Teams. The default time period is the past 31 days, but you can change it to show seven, 14, or 90 days instead.

To see definitions of the fields in the user activity report, see the [Microsoft Teams user activity report](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/user-activity-report) article.

### Team activity page

The **Team activity** page lists all the Teams teams you're a member of, and lists activity in each one, for example, posts and replies, active users, and guests. 

### Team activity details page

On the **Team activity details** page, you choose one of the Teams teams you're a member of, and drill in to view its the activities in the past 90 days. The page features a [smart narrative visual](../visuals/power-bi-visualization-smart-narrative.md). It automatically generates the **Activity summary**, a text description that calls attention to notable activity.

## View your Teams activity report

After you've created your Teams activity analytics report the first time, you can go back to it. On the Home tab in the Power BI app in Teams or in the Power BI service, you see it listed in **Recents**.

## Refresh your data

Select the **Refresh** icon in Power BI in Teams to refresh the data.

You'll see the most currently available data in Teams. It's not a real-time feed. You see a snapshot of the data, which is typically one to two days old.
