# Enable the Power BI/Power Apps Solutions integration (preview)

The Power BI/Power Apps solutions integration enables Power Apps app makers to add Power BI reports and datasets as Dataverse components in Power Apps solutions, and to seamlessly manage that content as part of their Application Lifecycle Management process across environments and tenants.

For the integration to work, the Power Platform Solutions Integration (Preview) must be **Enabled** in Power BI. It is enabled by default.

To change the integration setting, open the Power BI Admin portal, select **Tenant settings > Integration settings > Power Platform Solutions Integration (Preview)**, and move the toggle to the desired state (Disabled/Enabled).
