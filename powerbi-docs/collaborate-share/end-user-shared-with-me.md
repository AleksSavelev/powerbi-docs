# Display the dashboards and reports that others have shared with me

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]

Your colleagues have created apps, reports, dashboards, scorecards, workspaces, and datasets. When it comes time to share them with you or to ask for your collaboration, there are several ways that they can do this. In this article, we explain how to view and open content that others have shared with you.

## Interact with shared content

You have options for interacting with the shared dashboards and reports, depending on the permissions the *designer* gives you. These include being able to make copies of the dashboard, subscribe, edit a report, and reshare with other colleagues. For more information, see [Share reports and dashboards with coworkers and others](service-share-dashboards.md).

## Licenses for viewing shared content

To view content that others have shared with you, there are two options.

- **The content is *not* in a Power BI Premium capacity**: All business users need Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) licenses to view shared content.
- **The content *is* in a Power BI Premium capacity**: Business users without Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) licenses can view the content. However, you can't copy the reports, or create reports based on the underlying datasets. For more information, see [What is Power BI Premium?](../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md).

## View and open content from your *Shared with me* tab

Content that has been directly shared with you appears in your **Shared with me** tab. A link to shared content is sent to you in an email link or the *creator* or *owner* automatically installs it for you. To display the list, from the nav pane, select **Browse > Shared with me**. Scroll through **Shared with me** to see reports, dashboards, and scorecards.

From this list, you can [favorite](../consumer/end-user-favorite.md) and open content.

If your **Shared with me** content list gets long, you've several options for finding what you need. Sort by one of the columns (1), use the keyword filter field (2), or use the Filters pane (3). To open the Filters pane, select **Filters** from the upper right corner.

## Open shared content from an email link

When designers create or update content, they often share that content in an email. An email link gives you direct access to a single piece of content, such as a report or an app. Select the link to open and install the content.

## View and open content from your *Apps* tab

Apps that have been directly shared with you and apps that you've downloaded appear in your **Apps** tab. You've received these apps in one of the following ways:

- You received the app as a link in an email, and you clicked the link.
- The app *creator* or *owner* automatically installed the app for you.
- You installed the app from [AppSource](../consumer/end-user-apps.md#get-a-new-app).

Scroll through **Apps** to see reports, dashboards and scorecards. To display the list, from the nav pane, select the **Apps** icon.

For more information, see [Apps in Power BI](../consumer/end-user-apps.md).

## Collaborate on content in a *workspace*

One way that *creators* can share with you is by granting you a [role](service-roles-new-workspaces.md) in a workspace. What you can do with the content in that workspace depends on the role assigned to you: Viewer, Contributor, Member, Admin.
