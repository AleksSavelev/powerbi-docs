# Display the dashboards and reports that have been shared with me

[!INCLUDE[consumer-appliesto-yyny](../includes/consumer-appliesto-yyny.md)]


Your colleagues have created apps, reports, dashboards, scorecards, workspaces, and datasets. When it comes time to share them with you or to ask for your collaboration, there are several ways that they can do this. In this article, we explain how to view and open content that has been shared with you.

## Interact with shared content

You'll have options for interacting with the shared dashboards and reports, depending on the permissions the *designer* gives you. These include being able to make copies of the dashboard, subscribe, edit a report, and reshare with other colleagues. To learn more, see [Share reports and dashboards with coworkers and others](service-share-dashboards.md).

## Licenses for viewing shared content
To view content that has been shared with you, there are two options.

* **The content is *not* in a Power BI Premium capacity**: All business users need Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) licenses to view shared content.
* **The content *is* in a Power BI Premium capacity**: Business users without Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) licenses can view the content. However, you can't copy the reports, or create reports based on the underlying datasets. Read [What is Power BI Premium?](../enterprise/service-premium-gen2-what-is.md) for details.

## View and open content from your *Shared with me* tab
Content that has been directly shared with you is listed in your **Shared with me** tab. This content has been sent to you in an email link or the *creator* or *owner* has automatically installed it for you. To display the list, from the nav pane, select **Browse > Shared with me**. Scroll through **Shared with me** to see reports, dashboards and scorecards.

If you don't see **Shared with me**, select the Expand icon.

From this list, you can [favorite](../consumer/end-user-favorite.md) and open content. 

If your **Shared with me** content list gets long, you've several options for finding what you need. Use the search field (1), sort by one of the columns (2), or use the Filters pane. To open the Filters pane, select **Filters** from the upper right corner.

## Open shared content from an email link

When designers create or update content, they often share that content in email. An email link gives you direct access to a single piece of content, such as a report or an app. Select the link to open and install the content.

## View and open content from your *Apps* tab
Apps that have been directly shared with you and apps that you've downloaded are listed in your **Apps** tab. You've received these apps in one of the following ways:
- sent to you as a link in an email, and you've clicked the link
- the app *creator* or *owner* has automatically installed the app for you
- you've installed the app from [AppSource](../consumer/end-user-apps.md#get-a-new-app). 

Scroll through **Apps** to see reports, dashboards and scorecards. To display the list, from the nav pane, select the **Apps** icon.

To learn more, see [Install and use apps](../consumer/end-user-apps.md).

## Collaborate on content in a *workspace*
One way that *creators* can share with you is by granting you a [role](service-roles-new-workspaces.md) in a workspace. What you can do with the content in that workspace depends on the role you've been assigned: Viewer, Contributor, Member, Admin.
