# Embed a report page in PowerPoint

With the Power BI report add-in for PowerPoint, you can easily embed interactive Power BI report pages in PowerPoint slides.

Report pages embedded into PowerPoint using the Power BI report add-in for PowerPoint respect all Power BI permissions and data security, including [row-level security (RLS)](../enterprise/service-admin-rls.md), so your data remains secure.

## Requirements

To embed a Power BI report page into PowerPoint, the Power BI report add-in must be installed in PowerPoint. If it is not installed, see [Get the Power BI report add-in for PowerPoint](TBD).

## Embed your report

To embed a live Power BI report page into PowerPoint, you first need to get the URL to the page you want to embed. You then paste this URL into the Power BI report add-in in PowerPoint.

### Get the report page URL

There are three ways to get the report page URL:

* Through the **Share** option
* Through the **Export** option
* From the browser's address bar

These methods differ in whether or not they can preserve the report page's current state, and what permissions people who open the PowerPoint presentation will have for viewing the report. The table below summarizes the differences.

| URL source | Allows inserting current state | Can users who open the presentation view the report? |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Share     | Yes        | Yes        |
| Export     | Yes         |  Depends on the user's Power BI permissions |
| Address bar     | No        |  Depends on the user's Power BI permissions |

Use the **Share** option if you want to be sure that all users who open the presentation will be able to view the report.

Choose how you want to get the report page URL.

# [Share option](#tab/share)

1. Open the report to the page you want to insert. If desired, configure the page to the desired state using filters, selection, slicers, etc.

1. Choose **Share**.

1. Copy the URL to paste into the Power BI PowerPoint add-in. Alternatively choose **Open in PowerPoint** to insert the report page directly into a new, blank PowerPoint presentation.

Typically, the link generated by this method provides viewing access to the report.

# [Export option](#tab/export)

1. Open the report to the page you want to insert. If desired, configure the page to the desired state using filters, selection, slicers, etc.

1. Choose **Export > PowerPoint > Embed live data**.

Alternatively choose **Open in PowerPoint** to insert the report page directly into a new, blank PowerPoint presentation.
