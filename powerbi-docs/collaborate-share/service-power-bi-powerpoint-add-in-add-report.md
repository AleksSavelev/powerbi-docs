# View and present live Power BI report pages in PowerPoint

As soon as you add a live Power BI report page to PowerPoint, you can start interacting with your data just as you would in Power BI. The initial view is determined by the [URL](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-install.md#get-the-report-page-url) you used.

Live Power BI data added to PowerPoint is interactive in both edit and slide-show modes. Changes you make to the report state (via filtering, selection, slicing, etc.) in edit mode while setting up your slides are saved. By contrast, changes you make to the report state in slide show mode are not saved - when you exit the show, the report goes back to the state it was in when you left edit mode.

In addition to the Power BI data, other controls help you work with the data and set up your presentations.

These controls are described in detail in the [Controls](#controls) section.





## Understanding what you see

Report page - where you interact with data
Report info, where you see.....
Toolbar, where you ... hide ...

## Interact with data

You interact with the report just as you would in the Power BI service. You can apply filters and slicers, select data points, and drill down on data.

![Animated gif that shows interacting with the report](media/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-add-report/Animation2.gif)

As you work with the report, you can always restore the initial view if you want to go back to it. Use the **Reset** option in the [Report options](#report-options) menu.

## Prepare a slide show

If you need to present a slide show multiple times, you most likely want to set it up just once, and have it automatically return to its beginning state when it's finished, so you're ready to go for the next time. The add-in makes this easy. Since data selections you make in edit mode are saved, while selections you make in slide show mode are not, you can set up the presentation just once in advance in edit mode, and then present it as a slide show multiple times without having to set it up again each time, no matter how much slicing, dicing, and filtering you do in the course of the show - when the slide show is over, the report page goes back to the state it was in at the beginning of the slide show.

To get more space and a cleaner display for your slide show, you can collapse the toolbar across the bottom of the report page using the [Expand/Collapse Toolbar](#expandcollapse-toolbar) control.

## Freeze the current view

Sometimes you might want your data view to remain static. For this you can use the [Show as Saved Image](#add-in-side-pane) option. Show as Saved Image turns the current live view into a static, non-interactive image. To restore the interactive view, select the option again. The live report page will reload in the state it was last in, but with the latest data from Power BI.

## Share your presentation

When you share the presentation with others, to be able to view the data in the presentation they'll need an active Power BI account, a Pro license (or a Free license, if the report is hosted on a Premium capacity), and access to the report. This does not apply if you've frozen the view as a static image.

To make sure people in your org can access the report and take advantage of the live data experience, be sure to use the link generated in Power BI by the [Share > PowerPoint option](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-install.md?tabs=share#get-the-report-page-url). Any person you share the presentation with via this link will get access to the report.

Users who don't have permission to view the report can request access directly from the presentation, and will be able to view the data once they've received access.

## Restore the initial view

When you first add a live Power BI report page into PowerPoint, the initial view is determined by the [URL](./service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-install.md#get-the-report-page-url) you used. As you interact with your data and change the view, you can always restore the initial view if you want to go back to it. Use the **Reset** option in the [Report options](#report-options) menu.

## Controls

Controls that help you work with your data in PowerPoint are described below.

### Report info

![Screenshot of Power B I add-in for PowerPoint report info.](media/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-add-report/power-bi-powerpoint-addin-report-info.png)

* **Hyperlinked title**: Report name and page name. Click on the title to open Power BI to that report page.
* **Report sensitivity label**: Shows the sensitivity label applied to the report in Power BI. Note: this is not the sensitivity label (if any) applied to the PowerPoint file itself.
* **Last update from source**: Shows the time and date of the last data update from the data sources.

### Report options

![Screenshot of Power B I add-in for PowerPoint report options menu.](media/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-add-report/power-bi-powerpoint-addin-report-options.png)

* **Filter**: Shows or hides the filters pane, where you can filter your report, just like in the Power BI service. This option is available only if filters have been defined on the page.
* **Refresh**: Refreshes the report page with the latest data from the Power BI service. Note: Refresh does not trigger getting data from the data sources.
* **Reset**: Restores the state of the report page to the state it was in when it was first added to the PowerPoint presentation.

### Add-in options

![Screenshot of Power BI add-in for PowerPoint add-in options menu.](media/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-add-report/power-bi-powerpoint-addin-addin-options.png)

* **Clear**: Removes the report page from the add-in and returns you to the add-in **Insert** screen, where you can start over by pasting in a new report page URL.
* **Learn**: Opens help pages.

### Expand/collapse toolbar

![Screenshot of Power B I add-in for PowerPoint expand/collapse toolbar control.](media/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-add-report/power-bi-powerpoint-addin-expand-collapse-toolbar.png)

Expands or collapses the toolbar across the bottom of the report. This feature is particularly useful in Slide Show mode, when you need more space and want a cleaner display.

### Add-in side pane

![Screenshot of Power B I add-in for PowerPoint add-in side pane.](media/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-add-report/power-bi-powerpoint-addin-addin-sidebar.png)
* **Delete**: Removes the add-in from the PowerPoint slide.
* **Reload**: Reloads the report page. Use this option if visuals have been changed, added or deleted. The report page reloads every time PowerPoint is opened, so you need to use this option only if the report has changed while youâ€™ve had PowerPoint open.

    If all you want to do is refresh the data, use the **Refresh** option in the [Report options](#report-options) menu instead.

* **Show as Saved Image**: Converts the current state as a saved, static image. You can't interact with this image. Data is not updated. You can copy and paste this image wherever you want. Select **Show as Saved Image** again to restore the live current view. The report will reload. Note: If you select **Show as Saved Image** and then share the PowerPoint file, other users will be able to restore the live current view.
