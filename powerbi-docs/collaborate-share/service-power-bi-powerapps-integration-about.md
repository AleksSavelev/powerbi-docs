# About Power BI in Power Apps Solutions (preview)

When Power BI components are created in a Power Apps solution environment, a special Power BI workspace dedicated to that environment is created in Power BI. The report and dataset used to create the components are copied to that special workspace, and subsequent updates to the report or dataset are done using the items in the dedicated workspace.
