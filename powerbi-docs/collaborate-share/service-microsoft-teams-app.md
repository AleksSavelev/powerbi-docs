# Add the Power BI app to Microsoft Teams

This article describes how you can install, pin, and interact with Power BI right inside Microsoft Teams. The Power BI personal app brings the entire basic Power BI service experience to Microsoft Teams.

The Power BI app in Microsoft Teams is your personal experience of Power BI. It's as if the Power BI service lives inside Microsoft Teams.  After you install it, you can do almost everything in Microsoft Teams that you can do in the Power BI service:

- Create, view, and edit dashboards, reports, and apps.
- Create and participate in workspaces.
- Share content, either through email or through Microsoft Teams.

There are a few features that you can only access in the Power BI service in a browser. See the [Known issues and limitations](#known-issues-and-limitations) section of this article for details.

## Requirements

In general, for Power BI to work in Microsoft Teams, ensure these elements:

- You have a Power BI Pro license.
- You have signed in to the Power BI service to activate your Power BI license.

## Install the Power BI app

Select **More added apps (...)** in the left navigation bar, then select **Power BI**. If you don't see it, type **Power BI** in the **Find an app** box.

That's it! The Power BI app is installed in Microsoft Teams.

## Pin the Power BI app to the Teams navigation pane

To keep the app available in Teams, pin it to the Teams navigation pane.

- Right-click the Power BI icon in the Teams navigation pane, and select **Pin**.

That's it. Now it's there whenever you want to view your Power BI content in Teams.

## Interact with your content in Microsoft Teams

Interacting with your content in Microsoft Teams is the same as in the Power BI service. You interact with your dashboards, reports, apps, or workspaces in the same ways. 

You can even share a report to your coworkers in Microsoft Teams, from the Power BI app in Microsoft Teams.

### Differences in interactions

A few interactions are different in the Teams app than they are in the browser

- When you're looking at a dashboard or report, you don't see the Power BI navigation pane. Select the **Close** button to go back to Home or the workspace.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-microsoft-teams-app/power-bi-teams-close-report.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Close button in Power BI app in Microsoft Teams.":::

- You can choose to open the report in the Power BI service instead of viewing it in Microsoft Teams. Select **Open this on the web**.

## Search for Power BI content in Teams

With the new search experience in Teams, you can find recent reports, dashboards, and apps and open them within the Power BI app for Teams. Give the search experience a try.

1. In the Teams search bar, type *@Power BI*.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Be sure to include the space between "Power" and "BI".

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-microsoft-teams-app/power-bi-search-teams.png" alt-text="Type @Power BI in the Teams Search bar.":::

1. Select an item from the list, or type something to search for.

    :::image type="content" source="media/service-microsoft-teams-app/power-bi-search-teams-reports.png" alt-text="Select a dashboard, report, or other content from the list.":::

## Known issues and limitations

- Some options in the Power BI service aren't available in Microsoft Teams. These options include:
    - Notifications.
    - Downloading apps such as Power BI Desktop and Power BI Paginated Report Builder.
    - Sending feedback.
    - Settings such as managing personal storage and accessing the admin portal.
- Power BI doesn't support the same localized languages that Microsoft Teams does. As a result, you might not see proper localization within a report.
