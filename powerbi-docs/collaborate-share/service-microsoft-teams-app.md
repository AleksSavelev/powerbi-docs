# Add the Power BI app to Microsoft Teams

This article describes how you can install, pin, and interact with Power BI directly inside Microsoft Teams. The Power BI personal app brings the entire basic Power BI service experience to Microsoft Teams.

With Power BI app in Microsoft Teams you can [collaborate with Power BI in Teams](service-collaborate-microsoft-teams.md). The app is your personal experience of Power BI. It's as if the Power BI service lives inside Microsoft Teams.  After you install it, you can enjoy almost all features that's offered by the Power BI service in Microsoft Teams.

- Create, view, and edit dashboards, reports, and apps.
- Create and participate in workspaces.
- Share content, either through email or through Microsoft Teams.

Also, there's a feature in the Power BI app in Teams that you don't see when you view the Power [BI service](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) in a web browser. On the Power BI home page in Teams, you can [see all the Power BI tabs you've viewed](service-teams-pivot.md) in Teams.

There are a few features that you can only access in the Power BI service in a browser. See the [Known issues and limitations](#known-issues-and-limitations) section of this article for details.

## Increase Power BI app adoption in Teams

Your organization can make it easier for everyone to find and use data by installing and pinning (it's optional but we recommend it) the Power BI app for Teams.

Are you a leader in your organization? You can encourage individuals and teams to use the Power BI app in Teams by installing it for themselves. Read the [Guide to enabling your organization to use Power BI in Microsoft Teams](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/guide-to-enabling-your-organization-to-use-power-bi-in-microsoft-teams/) to learn about the options for broad and targeted roll-out and decide whatâ€™s right for your organization.

### Install the Power BI app for Teams automatically

Are you a Power BI admin or a Teams admin? By default, the Power BI app for Teams is installed automatically in some circumstances. See [Install the Power BI app for Teams automatically](../admin/service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#install-the-power-bi-app-for-teams-automatically) for details. To encourage the users in your organization to use the app more regularly, pin the app proactively in Teams through an app setup policy. It's useful to include Power BI as a pinned app, so users in Teams can easily find and use data. After November 1, 2021, Power BI app's installation occurs automatically for users who visit the Power BI service and meet the criteria.

Power BI end users might see a notification in the Power BI service notification pane that says the Microsoft Teams app was automatically installed.
