# Power BI add-in for PowerPoint - Admin info

The Power BI add-in for PowerPoint enables users to add live, interactive data from Power BI to PowerPoint presentations. Currently, the add-in supports adding report pages to PowerPoint slides individually. The left-hand page navigation pane is not brought in by the add-in, but any page navigation visuals on the report page itself will function normally as they do in the Power BI service.

## Requirements

To use the Power BI add-in for PowerPoint, users must either have access to the Office add-in store, or the add-in must be made available to them as an [admin managed add-in](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).

## Licensing

To be able to view live Power BI data in PowerPoint, users must have an active Power BI account and a Power BI Free license, as well as access to the data. If the Power BI report is not located in a Premium capacity, a Power BI Pro license is needed.

If auto-licensing for Power BI is enabled, users without a Power BI account will be signed up automatically when they open a presentation containing a live Power BI report page. **This may impact the assignment and availability of licenses in your organization**. See [Power BI license assignment](../enterprise/service-admin-disable-self-service.md) for more information.

If auto-licensing is not enabled, users without Power BI accounts will be requested to sign up.

## Power BI entry points

By default, the Power BI service includes entry points that enable users to insert the add-in into new PowerPoint presentations directly from Power BI. Power BI admins can disable this functionality by turning off the **Enable Power BI add-in for PowerPoint** tenant setting. See [Enable Power BI add-in for PowerPoint](../admin/service-admin-portal-export-sharing.md#enable-power-bi-add-in-for-powerpoint) for detail.

>[!NOTE]
> Disabling this functionality in Power BI does not prevent people from adding Power BI report pages to PowerPoint slides starting from PowerPoint. To completely block adding live Power BI report pages to PowerPoint slides using the add-in, the functionality must be disabled in both Power BI and PowerPoint.

Power BI entry points for the add-in are not available in sovereign, government, and air-gapped clouds. See the Microsoft Office documentation for information about the availability of the add-in in PowerPoint in these clouds.

## Power BI add-in button in PowerPoint Insert ribbon

If your organization has a Microsoft 365 Office subscription, a button for the add-in will appear in the PowerPoint ribbon.

The button is a shortcut to the add-in offering in the Office add-in store. The button itself doesn't provide access to the store. If the user does not have access to the store, the button won't work.

The rollout of the Power BI add-in for PowerPoint depends on the update cadence of your organization's Microsoft 365 subscription. Hence the add-in may not immediately be available in your organization. To ensure availability of the add-in, use the latest version of Microsoft 365.
