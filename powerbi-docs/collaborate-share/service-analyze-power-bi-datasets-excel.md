# Analyze Power BI datasets in Excel

You've connected to a Power BI dataset in Excel by starting in Power BI with Analyze in Excel or in Excel with Get Data. Now that you're connected, Excel presents you with an empty *PivotTable* and *Fields* list from the Power BI dataset, and you're ready analyze your data.

The Excel file has an MSOLAP connection string that connects to your dataset in Power BI. When you analyze or work with the data, Excel queries that dataset in Power BI and returns the results to Excel. If that dataset connects to a live data source using DirectQuery, Power BI queries the data source and returns the result to Excel.

With that connection to the data in Power BI now established, you can create PivotTables, charts, and analyze that dataset just as you would work with a local dataset in Excel.

## Refresh the data

You can refresh the Power BI dataset connection to update your reports in Excel in one of two ways.

- Right-click anywhere in the PivotTable and select **Refresh**.

- Select **Data** in the Excel ribbon and select **Refresh**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Refresh** updates the Power BI connection string for the report you see on the sheet. **Refresh All** updates all the connection strings in the Excel workbook, including non-Power BI data sources.

## Data sources for Analyze in Excel

Analyze in Excel is especially useful for Power BI datasets and reports that connect to the following data sources:

* Azure Analysis Services *tabular* data models and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) *tabular* or *multidimensional* data models.

    Connection to datasets from live connection to Analysis Services (Azure and SQL Server) aren't currently supported.

* Power BI Desktop files or Excel workbooks with data models that have model measures created using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX).

With **Excel for the web**, you can now explore and refresh Excel workbooks connected to Power BI datasets. If you have downloaded an Analyze in Excel workbook from Power BI or connected directly to a Power BI dataset from the Excel desktop app, you can share and refresh these workbooks through OneDrive and SharePoint. You can copy the link to the OneDrive or SharePoint location by clicking the **Share** button in the Excel desktop app and pasting the link directly in a browser. Now you start working with PivotTables connected to Power BI datasets in Excel for the web just like you would in the Excel desktop app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using Analyze in Excel exposes all detail-level data to any users with permission to the dataset.

There are a handful of things to consider when you begin using Analyze in Excel, which might require an extra step or two to reconcile. These possibilities are described in the following sections. 

## Prerequisites

Here are the requirements for connecting to Power BI datasets in Excel:

* Analyze in Excel is supported for Microsoft Excel 2010 SP1 and later.
* Excel PivotTables don't support drag-and-drop aggregation of numeric fields. Your dataset in Power BI *must have pre-defined measures*. Read about [creating measures](../transform-model/desktop-measures.md).
* Some organizations may have Group Policy rules that prevent installing the required Analyze in Excel updates to Excel. If you can't install the updates, check with your administrator.
* Analyze in Excel requires that the dataset be in a Power BI Premium workspace or that you have a Power BI Pro or Premium Per User (PPU) license. To learn more about the differences in functionality between license types, take a look at the _Power BI features comparison_ section of [Power BI pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/).
* You can connect to datasets through Analyze in Excel if you have permission for the underlying dataset. You could have this permission in a few ways. You  could have the Member role in the workspace containing the dataset, or have Build permission for a dataset in a workspace, or in an app that contains the dataset. Read more about [Build permission](../connect-data/service-datasets-build-permissions.md) for datasets.
* Guest users can't use Analyze in Excel for datasets sent from (originating from) another tenant. 
* Analyze in Excel is a Power BI service feature. It isn't available in Power BI Report Server or Power BI Embedded.
* Analyze in Excel is only supported on computers running Microsoft Windows.
* When sharing an Excel workbook via a Power BI app, you have to provide Build permissions to the dataset in the app, and permissions to the OneDrive or SharePoint location for the Excel workbook. If you use the **Entire organization** setting when providing permissions to users in the Power BI app, you have to set the equivalent permission setting in OneDrive or SharePoint for the Excel workbook.

If you need to uninstall the Analyze in Excel feature, use the **Add or remove programs** system setting on your computer.

### Sign in to Power BI
Although youâ€™re signed in to Power BI in your browser, the first time you open a new Excel file in Excel you may be asked to sign in to Power BI with your Power BI account. This authenticates the connection from Excel to Power BI.

### Multiple Power BI accounts

If you have multiple Power BI accounts, you might be signed in to Power BI with one account, but your other account has access to the dataset being used in Analyze in Excel. In that case, you might see a **Forbidden** error, or a sign-in failure when attempting to access a dataset that's being used in an Analyze in Excel workbook.

If that happens, you'll be provided an opportunity to sign in again, at which time you can sign in with the Power BI account that has access to the dataset being accessed by Analyze in Excel. You can also select your name in the top ribbon in Excel, which identifies which account is currently signed in. Sign out and sign back in with the other account.

## Considerations and limitations

- Row-level security (RLS) is supported for Analyze in Excel. RLS is enforced at the data-model level, and is always applied to all users accessing data in the report. Read more about [row-level security](../admin/service-admin-rls.md).
- There may be times when using Analyze in Excel that you get an unexpected result, or the feature doesn't work as you expected. See [Troubleshoot Analyze in Excel](desktop-troubleshooting-analyze-in-excel.md) for solutions to common issues.
- Only Power BI datasets that use Import mode will preserve hierarchies in Analyze in Excel workbooks. Power BI datasets built on DirectQuery or composite models will not have their hierarchies retained when using Analyze in Excel.
- Analyze in Excel doesn't support specifying a locale by modifying the connection string _after_ a workbook has been generated.
- You may see an error message if the data is larger than 2 GB. In that case, either reduce the amount of data, for example by applying filters, or use the XMLA endpoint. Learn more about the [XMLA endpoint](../admin/service-premium-connect-tools.md).
