# Export Power BI paginated reports with Power Automate

With [Power Automate](/power-automate/getting-started), you can automate exporting and distributing Power BI paginated reports to a variety of supported formats and scenarios. In this article, you learn which templates to use to build your own flows to export your paginated reports.  

## Prerequisites

- Access to the standard connectors in Power Automate, which come with any Office 365 subscription.
