# Create a Support Ticket

Fabric and Power BI admin and users can contact support to get self-help solutions in real-time for their issue through either the [Power Platform Admin Center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/support) (admins only) or the [Fabric Support Page](https://support.fabric.microsoft.com/en-US/support). If the issue can't be resolved through self-help, you can use the same **Contact Support** experience to contact a Microsoft support representative.
