   >- For **Contract ID/Password**, enter your Unified or Premier contract ID.
   >- The **Contract ID/Password** defaults to the Unified or Premier contract ID. If you've changed the password when registering online in the Unified/Premier portal, you should use the updated password instead of the contract ID.



### For Fabric users and Power BI Pro users

On the [Fabric Support page](https://support.fabric.microsoft.com/en-US/support), review the status dashboard, outage/degradation and **Awareness** fields, and **Known issues** to ensure that your issue is not already known. Then, scroll down to **Create a support request** and select the product you're experiencing an issue with.
